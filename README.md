The awesome-gee-community-datasets are community-sourced geospatial datasets made available for use by the larger Google Earth Engine community and shared publicly as Earth Engine assets. The project was started with the idea that a lot of research datasets are often unavailable for direct use and require preprocessing before use. This catalog lives and serves alongside the [Google Earth Engine data catalog](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog) and also houses datasets that are often requested by the community and under a variety of open license.

You can read about the history and more in the [Medium Post article here](https://medium.com/geospatial-processing-at-scale/community-datasets-data-commons-in-google-earth-engine-8585d8baef1f)
