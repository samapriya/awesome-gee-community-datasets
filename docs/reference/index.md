# Reference & Citation

While most datasets in our community catalog are citable themselves, it's important to note that the catalog as a whole should also be cited by users. Our citation information and release details are sourced from [**Zenodo**](https://zenodo.org) and you can always find the latest [DOI & Citation here](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.7144933).

We encourage participation in our releases by contributing code examples, tutorials, edits through pull requests, documentation, or by being involved in planning and developing the community catalog further. Your contributions ensure that you are recognized as part of the citation for each release.
