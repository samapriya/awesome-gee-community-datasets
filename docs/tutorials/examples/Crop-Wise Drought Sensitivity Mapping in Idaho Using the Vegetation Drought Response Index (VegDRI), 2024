 Crop-Wise Drought Sensitivity Mapping in Idaho Using the Vegetation Drought Response Index (VegDRI), 2024
 
1. What Is VegDRI? 
The Vegetation Drought Response Index (VegDRI) is a weekly drought-monitoring product for the United States.
It helps identify how vegetation is responding to drought stress, not just climate dryness.
VegDRI was developed jointly by:
•	USGS EROS Center
•	National Drought Mitigation Center (NDMC), University of Nebraska
•	High Plains Regional Climate Center (HPRCC)
VegDRI combines:
 Satellite-based Vegetation Condition Metrics
•	Derived from MODIS (Terra) at 1 km resolution
•	Uses two important NDVI-based indicators:
o	PASG — Percent Annual Seasonal Greenness
o	SOSA — Start of Season Anomaly
These capture how green the vegetation should be, and how abnormal the growing season start is.
 Climate-Based Drought Indicators
•	Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI)
•	Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI)
These detect dryness and water deficit.
 Biophysical & Environmental Data
•	Land use / land cover
•	Soil available water capacity
•	Elevation
•	Irrigation status
•	Ecological region
Environmental stresses (fire, pests, flooding, hail, land-use change) can also modify vegetation condition.
Why VegDRI Is Useful for Agriculture
Unlike basic drought indices, VegDRI tells us exactly how crops are reacting to drought conditions.
For Idaho croplands (e.g., alfalfa, potatoes, barley, wheat), VegDRI helps quantify:
•	Which crops show higher drought stress
•	Where crop-specific vulnerability exists
•	Spatial differences within the same crop type
•	Crop-wise sensitivity patterns within a single year (2024)

1. Idaho Boundary
var idaho = ee.FeatureCollection('TIGER/2018/States')
  .filter(ee.Filter.eq('NAME', 'Idaho'));
This isolates Idaho for all VegDRI calculations.
Everything is clipped or masked to this boundary.
 
2. Load VegDRI Weekly Images for 2024
var vegdri_raw = ee.ImageCollection('projects/climate-engine-pro/assets/ce-veg-dri')
  .filterBounds(idaho)
  .filterDate('2024-01-01', '2025-01-01');
VegDRI is produced weekly, so 2024 contains ~52 images.
Using all weeks captures season-long drought behavior.
 
Scale VegDRI Values
function scaleVeg(img){
  return img.addBands(
    img.select("vegdri")
      .subtract(128)
      .divide(16)
      .rename("vegdri_scale")
  );
}
var veg2024 = vegdri_raw.map(scaleVeg);
VegDRI stores values as encoded integers.
The decoding function converts to a continuous −5 to +5 drought scale.
 
3. VegDRI Color Palette
var vegPaletteSimple = [
  "#720206","#cb3121","#e36b09","#fee301",
  "#ffffff","#88f9c7","#53c285","#2b8032"
];

This palette moves from extreme drought → extreme moisture,
mirroring VegDRI’s conceptual scale.
 
4. Cropland Data Layer (CDL)
var cdl = ee.ImageCollection("USDA/NASS/CDL")
  .filterBounds(idaho)
  .sort("system:time_start", false)
  .first();

Each pixel in CDL represents a specific crop type.
This allows VegDRI to be extracted per crop.
Your Idaho crop list:
•	Corn
•	Barley
•	Spring Wheat
•	Winter Wheat
•	Alfalfa
•	Potatoes
•	Sugarbeets
 
5. Annual VegDRI Composite
var veg_annual = veg2024
  .select("vegdri_scale")
  .mean();

Taking the mean of all VegDRI weeks gives a season-integrated drought view,
which smooths short-term weather noise and highlights overall crop stress patterns.
 
6. Crop-Specific VegDRI Maps
function addCropAnnual(crop){
  var mask = cdl.eq(crop.value).selfMask();
  var layer = veg_annual.updateMask(mask);
  Map.addLayer(layer, {min:-5, max:5, palette: vegPaletteSimple}, crop.name);
}
crops.forEach(addCropAnnual);

Different crops react to water stress differently.
This step creates one VegDRI layer per crop, so we can compare sensitivity:
•	Cereals (barley, wheat) may show early-season stress
•	Potatoes are highly drought sensitive
•	Alfalfa can be resilient but still affected in dry irrigation cycles
 
7. Crop-Wise Drought Statistics
reduceRegion({ reducer: mean + stdDev })
This computes average VegDRI + standard deviation for each crop.

•	Mean VegDRI shows general drought intensity
•	StdDev tells how variable the stress was across growing areas
(useful for crops grown in both irrigated and semi-arid zones)
 
8. Bar Chart (Mean VegDRI per Crop)
ui.Chart.feature.byFeature(stats_fc, 'crop', ['mean'])
Theory:
This provides a quick crop-ranking of drought stress,
useful for:
•	drought impact assessment
•	crop sensitivity comparison
•	irrigation management insights
