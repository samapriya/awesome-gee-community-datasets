# Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) Land Cover Classification Gridded Maps (1992 -2022)

This dataset from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) provides global annual land cover (LC) maps from 1992 to the present. The maps describe the land surface using 22 classes defined by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization’s (UN FAO) Land Cover Classification System (LCCS). This dataset is designed for consistency with the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) global annual LC maps from 1992-2015. The product is tailored for climate modelling communities but is also valuable for applications like forest monitoring, land accounting, and desertification studies due to its long-term consistency and yearly updates.

#### Dataset Description

The C3S LC maps are produced at a spatial resolution of approximately 300m (~0.00278°). The production methodology ensures temporal consistency across the entire series. A unique 10-year baseline LC map was first generated using the entire archive (2003-2012) of Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) data. This baseline is then annually updated (and was initially back-dated) by detecting land cover changes.

Change detection is performed using a variety of satellite time series:

* Advanced Very-High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) for the period 1992-1999.
* SPOT-Vegetation (SPOT-VGT) for 1999-2013.
* PROBA-Vegetation (PROBA-V) for 2014-2019.
* Sentinel-3 OLCI and SLSTR for 2020 onwards.

In addition to the land cover class layer, the dataset includes four quality flag layers that provide information on the pixel state, processing status, number of observations, and the number of changes detected over the time series.

#### Available Layers

The dataset includes the main land cover classification layer and several quality flag layers.

| Variable Name | Description | Units |
|---------------|-------------|-------|
| `lccs_class` | Land cover class per pixel, defined using the UN LCCS legend of 22 primary classes. The full legend is available in the product user guide.| Dimensionless |
| `processed_flag` | A flag indicating whether a pixel was processed (1) or not (0). | Dimensionless |
| `current_pixel_state` | Identifies the pixel's status from observations, distinguishing between clear land, water, snow/ice, cloud, and cloud shadow. | Dimensionless |
| `observation_count` | The number of valid observations used to derive the baseline classification for each pixel. | Dimensionless |
| `change_count` | The number of LC changes observed per pixel during the period from 1992 to the latest map year. | Dimensionless |
