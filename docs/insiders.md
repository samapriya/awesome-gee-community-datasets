The awesome GEE community catalog **insiders program** is designed for those who are helping keep open source projects sustainable and support the growth and curation of the catalog. As such this program is for sponsors and data contributors to the project. If you fit under any of those categories [fill this form](https://forms.gle/VPmETGKyvMAd37MV6) to get insiders access.

What do you get when you sign up for the Insiders program?

* You are added to a Google Group called catalog-contributors
* This will give you early access to certain datasets as they are being processed, reviewed and some unreleased yet.
* You will also recieve changelog and updates emails once in a while and you can post to the google group with questions, concerns and thoughts

Any and all support is appreciated you can sponsor the project using the sponrship links as well as contributing and helping data curation for the catalog.

*All datasets that are part of the insiders’ program are released within a few months to the general catalog, along with the monthly release cycle for the catalog.*
