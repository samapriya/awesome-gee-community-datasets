The awesome-gee-community-catalog is an unfunded open source grassroots project with a mission to help collect community sourced and community generated geospatial datasets. Our goal is to make data accessible and tie it to an analysis platform fostering accessibility and reducing digital divide.</p> <p>The catalog was created by and maintained by Dr. Samapriya Roy and this is currently a one person team. A Google Developer Expert for Google Earth Engine and Senior Product Manager at MAXAR,an open source developer and a Geospatial Consultant &amp; Speaker. Dr. Roy leads Developer Relations and champions open data access. Leveraging geospatial expertise as an affiliate faculty at the University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa and a Designated Campus Colleague at the University of Arizona, Dr. Roy further drives the mission of the catalog.</p> <p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>The catalog is further a result of data requests and tutorial contributions from the #awesome community who use the community catalog and input, advise and feedback from community members. Our mission is to make geospatial data accessible and analysis-ready, fostering collaboration and reducing the digital divide. The Awesome GEE Community Catalog thrives on community participation and open-source principles. We aim to build on creating accessibility to high-quality geospatial data, enabling researchers, developers, and enthusiasts to leverage these resources for their projects. This year the National Science Foundation (NSF) ACCESS program granted us 1.5 million Service Units or CPU Core hours to continue the work on the catalog through Jestream2 a NSF project which allow us to preprocess the datasets as requests are made.</p>"},{"location":"about_us/#community-contributions","title":"Community Contributions","text":"<p>Our catalog is powered by the contributions of the GEE user base. Community members submit datasets that are then reviewed, usually downloaded and preprocess and made Earth Engine ready and finally added to the catalog for everyone to use. This collaborative approach ensures a diverse and rich collection of data, covering a wide range of topics from waterbodies and population distribution to drought monitoring and more. Each contribution helps expand our repository, making it a go-to resource for geospatial data. \ud83d\udd0d</p>"},{"location":"about_us/#update-schedule","title":"Update Schedule","text":"<p>We understand the importance of keeping datasets current and reliable. While some datasets are regularly updated on a fixed cadence, others follow a more ad hoc schedule. Updates are made as requests come in or as additional information becomes available about a dataset. This flexible approach allows us to respond to the community's needs and maintain the relevance and accuracy of the data we provide. \ud83d\uddd3\ufe0f</p> <p>We rely on users to spread the word and share the catalog with other users. Please cite and attribute the catalog using our citation making this project more visible and relevant.</p> <p>To get involved check out our Get Involved

This community thrives on constant innovation and collaboration, evident in the ongoing iterations and shared code libraries. Inspired by this collaborative spirit, we embarked on a project to create a community-curated data repository \u2013 a space where users could contribute and access valuable geospatial datasets.</p> <p>The impetus for this project arose from a specific user query. Someone inquired about Facebook's high-resolution population density maps, a dataset absent from the official GEE catalog. This presented a perfect opportunity to experiment with a community-driven data commons. The dataset, hosted by Columbia University, offered detailed population data at an impressive 30-meter resolution.You can read the foundational blog here</p> <p>This Facebook dataset became the first and most frequently updated entry in the community catalog, now known as the #Awesome GEE Community Catalog.</p>"},{"location":"history/#guiding-principle","title":"Guiding Principle","text":"<p>The guiding principle behind this catalog draws inspiration from Elinor Ostrom's groundbreaking work on commons governance, a philosophy that has underpinned successful open-source projects like Linux and collaborative platforms like Wikipedia. Just as shared norms within a physical commons benefit everyone, fostering a similar collaborative environment within the digital realm was our goal.The idea was to use the inspiration from Digital Commons and create a Community Data Commons in the form of the #Awesome GEE Community Catalog.</p> <p></p> <p>The #Awesome GEE Community Catalog aims to reduce barriers for users by providing easy access to a growing collection of public datasets. This democratizes access to valuable geospatial data, similar to how GEE itself has democratized access to processing capabilities. However, the challenge lies in effectively applying these principles to both large-scale datasets and smaller, user-contributed ones. The Earth Engine ecosystem itself thrives on a culture of community learning, adaptation, and iteration.This community data commons serves as a bridge, connecting users with the datasets they need and fostering further collaboration within the GEE community. The #Awesome GEE Community Catalog represents a collaborative effort, and its continued success relies on the active participation of its users.</p>"},{"location":"involved/","title":"Stay updated &amp; contribute","text":"<p>The Awesome GEE Community Catalog is created and maintained by Samapriya Roy with data, examples, tutorial contributions from our community.

By providing the AgERA5 dataset, users are freed from this work and can directly start with meaningful input for their analyses and modeling. To this end, the variables provided in this dataset match the input needs of most agriculture and agro-ecological models. Data were aggregated to daily time steps at the local time zone and corrected towards a finer topography at a 0.1\u00b0 spatial resolution. The correction to the 0. 1\u00b0 grid was realized by applying grid and variable-specific regression equations to the ERA5 dataset interpolated at 0.1\u00b0 grid. The equations were trained on ECMWF's operational high-resolution atmospheric model (HRES) at a 0.1\u00b0 resolution. This way the data are tuned to the finer topography, finer land use pattern, and finer land-sea delineation of the ECMWF HRES model.

Geospatially explicit and, ideally, highly resolved information is required to manage terrestrial ecosystems, mitigate climate change, and prevent biodiversity loss. Here, we present the first global, wall-to-wall canopy height map at 10 m ground sampling distance for the year 2020. No single data source meets these requirements: dedicated space missions like GEDI deliver sparse height data, with unprecedented coverage, whereas optical satellite images like Sentinel-2 offer dense observations globally, but cannot directly measure vertical structures. By fusing GEDI with Sentinel-2, we have developed a probabilistic deep learning model to retrieve canopy height from Sentinel-2 images anywhere on Earth, and to quantify the uncertainty in these estimates.</p> <p>The presented approach reduces the saturation effect commonly encountered when estimating canopy height from satellite images, allowing to resolve tall canopies with likely high carbon stocks. According to our map, only 5% of the global landmass is covered by trees taller than 30 m. Such data play an important role for conservation, e.g., we find that only 34% of these tall canopies are located within protected areas. Our model enables consistent, uncertainty-informed worldwide mapping and supports an ongoing monitoring to detect change and inform decision making. The approach can serve ongoing efforts in forest conservation, and has the potential to foster advances in climate, carbon, and biodiversity modelling.

The main objective of the 'S2 prototype LC map at 20m of Africa 2016' release was to collect users feedback for further improvements. The Coordinate Reference System used for the global land cover database is a geographic coordinate system (GCS) based on the World Geodetic System 84 (WGS84) reference ellipsoid.</p> <p>The legend of the S2 prototype LC 20m map of Africa 2016 was built after reviewing various existing typologies (e.g. LCCS, LCML\u2026), global (e.g. GLC-share, GlobeLand30) and national experiences (Africover, SERVIR-RMCD).

You can get additional information on the dataset here and on the climateengine.org dataset page here</p> <ul> <li> <p>Build-up Index: The Build-Up Index is a weighted combination of the Duff moisture code and Drought code to indicate the total amount of fuel available for combustion by a moving flame front. The Duff moisture code has the most influence on the Build-up index value. For example, a Duff moisture code value of zero always results in a Build-up index value of zero regardless of what the Drought code value is. The Drought code has the strongest influence on the Build-up index when Duff moisture code values are high. The greatest effect that the Drought code can have is to make the Build-up index value equal to twice the Duff moisture code value. The Build-up index is often used for pre-suppression planning purposes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Burning Index: The Burning Index measures the difficulty of controlling a fire. It is derived from a combination of Spread component (how fast it will spread) and Energy release component (how much energy will be produced). In this way, it is related to flame length, which, in the Fire Behavior Prediction System, is based on rate of spread and heat per unit area. However, because of differences in the calculations for Burning index and flame length, they are not the same.</p> </li> <li> <p>Drought Code: The Drought code is an indicator of the moisture content in deep compact organic layers. This code represents a fuel layer at approximately 10-20 cm deep. The Drought code fuels have a very slow drying rate, with a time lag of 52 days. The Drought code scale is open-ended, although the maximum value is about 800.</p> </li> <li> <p>Drought Factor: The drought factor is a component representing fuel availability. It is is given as a number between 0 and 10 and represents the influence of recent temperatures and rainfall events on fuel availability (see Griffiths 1998 for details). The Drought Factor is partly based on the soil moisture deficit which is commonly calculated in Australia as the Keetch-Byram Drought Index (KBDI) (also available). The KBDI estimates the soil moisture below saturation up to a maximum</p> </li> <li> <p>Duff Moisture Code: The Duff moisture code is an indicatore of the moisture content in loosely-compacted organic layers of moderate depth. It is representative of the duff layer that is 5-10 cm deep. Duff moisture code fuels are affected by rain, temperature and relative humidity. Because these fuels are below the forest floor surface, wind speed does not affect the fuel moisture content. The Duff moisture code fuels have a slower drying rate than the Fine fuel moisture code fuels, with a timelag of 12 days. Although the Duff moisture code has an open-ended scale, the highest probable value is in the range of 150.</p> </li> <li> <p>Energy Release Component: The Energy release component is a number related to the available energy (British Thermal Unit) per unit area (square foot) within the flaming front at the head of a fire. Daily variations in Energy release component are due to changes in moisture content of the various fuels present, both live and dead. Since this number represents the potential \"heat release\" per unit area in the flaming zone, it can provide guidance to several important fire activities. It may also be considered a composite fuel moisture value as it reflects the contribution that all live and dead fuels have to potential fire intensity. The Energy release component is a cumulative or \"build-up\" type of index. As live fuels cure and dead fuels dry, the Energy release component values get higher thus providing a good reflection of drought conditions. The scale is open-ended or unlimited and, as with other National Forest Danger Rating System components, is relative.</p> </li> <li> <p>Fine Fuel Moisture Code: The Fine fuel moisture code is an indicatore of the moisture content in litter and other cured fine fuels (needles, mosses, twigs less than 1 cm in diameter). The Fine fuel moisture code is representative of the top litter layer less than 1-2 cm deep. Fine fuel moisture code values change rapidly because of a high surface area to volume ratio, and direct exposure to changing environmental conditions. The Fine fuel moisture code scale ranges from 0-99 and is the only component of the Fire weather index system which does not have an open-ended scale. Generally, fires begin to ignite at Fine fuel moisture code values near 70, and the maximum probable value that will ever be achieved is 96.</p> </li> <li> <p>Fire Daily Severity Rating: Numeric rating of the difficulty of controlling fires. It is an exponential transformation of the Fire weather index and more accurately reflects the expected efforts required for fire suppression as it increases exponentially as the Fire weather index is above a certain value.</p> </li> <li> <p>Fire Danger Index: The Fire danger index is a metric related to the chances of a fire starting, its rate of spread, its intensity, and its difficulty of suppression. It is open ended however a value of 50 and above is considered extreme in most vegetation</p> </li> <li> <p>Fire Weather Index:The Fire weather index is a combination of Initial spread index and Build-up index, and is a numerical rating of the potential frontal fire intensity. In effect, it indicates fire intensity by combining the rate of fire spread with the amount of fuel being consumed. Fire weather index values are not upper bounded however a value of 50 is considered as extreme in many places. The Fire weather index is used for general public information about fire danger conditions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ignition Component: The Ignition component measures the probability a firebrand will require suppression action. Since it is expressed as a probability, it ranges on a scale of 0 to 100. An Ignition component of 100 means that every firebrand will cause a fire requiring action if it contacts a receptive fuel. Likewise an Ignition component of 0 would mean that no firebrand would cause a fire requiring suppression action under those conditions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Initial Fire Spread Index: The Initial spread index combines the Fine fuel moisture code and wind speed to indicate the expected rate of fire spread. Generally, a 13 km h-1 increase in wind speed will double the Initial spread index value. The Initial spread index is accepted as a good indicator of fire spread in open light fuel stands with wind speeds up to 40 km h-1.</p> </li> <li> <p>Keetch-Byram Drought Index: The Keetch-Byram drought index (KBDI) is a number representing the net effect of evapotranspiration and precipitation in producing cumulative moisture deficiency in deep duff and upper soil layers. It is a continuous index, relating to the flammability of organic material in the ground.The Keetch-Byram drought index attempts to measure the amount of precipitation necessary to return the soil to saturated conditions. It is a closed system ranging from 0 to 200 units and represents a moisture regime from 0 to 20 cm of water through the soil layer. At 20 cm of water, the Keetch-Byram drought index assumes saturation. Zero is the point of no moisture deficiency and 200 is the maximum drought that is possible. At any point along the scale, the index number indicates the amount of net rainfall that is required to reduce the index to zero, or saturation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Spread Component: The Spread component is a measure of the spead at which a headfire would spread. The spread component is numerically equal to the theoretical ideal rate of spread expressed in feet-per-minute however is considered as a dimensionless variable. The Spread component is expressed on an open-ended scale; thus it has no upper limit.</p> </li> </ul> <p> Spatial Extent Global Spatial Resolution ~25km (0.25 deg) Temporal Resolution Daily Time Span 1940-01-01 to Present Update Frequency Updated daily with one week lag <p></p> <p> Variables Build-up Index ('build_up_index') - Units: Dimensionless - Scale Factor: 1.0 Burning Index ('burning_index') - Units: Dimensionless - Scale Factor: 1.0 Drought Code ('drought_code') - Units: Dimensionless - Scale Factor: 1.0 Drought Factor ('drought_factor') - Units: Dimensionless - Scale Factor: 1.0 Duff Moisture Code ('duff_moisture_code') - Units: Dimensionless - Scale Factor: 1.0 Energy Release Component ('energy_release_component') - Units: J/m2 - Scale Factor: 1.0 Fine Fuel Moisture Code ('fine_fuel_moisture_code') - Units: Dimensionless - Scale Factor: 1.0 Fire Daily Severity Rating ('fire_daily_severity_rating') - Units: Dimensionless - Scale Factor: 1.0 Fire Danger Index ('fire_danger_index') - Units: Dimensionless - Scale Factor: 1.0 Fire Weather Index ('fire_weather_index') - Units: Dimensionless - Scale Factor: 1.0 Ignition Component ('ignition_component') - Units: % - Scale Factor: 1.0 Initial Fire Spread Index ('initial_fire_spread_index') - Units: Dimensionless - Scale Factor: 1.0 Keetch-Byram Drought Index ('keetch_byram_drought_index') - Units: Dimensionless - Scale Factor: 1.0 Spread Component ('spread_component') - Units: Dimensionless - Scale Factor: 1.0 <p></p>"},{"location":"projects/cems_fire/#citation","title":"Citation","text":"<pre><code>Vitolo, C., Di Giuseppe, F., Barnard, C., Coughlan, R., San-Miguel-Ayanz, J., Libert\u00e1, G., &amp; Krzeminski, B.

Net carbon flux is calculated by subtracting average annual gross removals from average annual gross emissions in each modeled pixel; negative values are where forests were net sinks of carbon and positive values are where forests were net sources of carbon between 2001 and 2023. Net fluxes are calculated following IPCC Guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories in each pixel where forests existed in 2000 or were established between 2000 and 2012 according to the Global Forest Change tree cover change data of Hansen et al. (2013). This layer reflects the cumulative net flux during the model period (2001-2023) and must be divided by 23 to obtain average annual net flux; net flux values cannot be assigned to individual years of the model.</p> <p>Forest carbon removals from the atmosphere (sequestration) by forest sinks represent the cumulative carbon captured (megagrams CO2/ha) by the growth of established and newly regrowing forests during the model period between 2001-2023. Removals include accumulation of carbon in both aboveground and belowground live tree biomass. Following IPCC Tier 1 assumptions for forests remaining forests, removals by dead wood, litter, and soil carbon pools are assumed to be zero. In each pixel, carbon removals are calculated following IPCC Guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories where forests existed in 2000 or were established between 2000 and 2012 according to the Global Forest Change tree cover loss data of Hansen et al. (2013). Carbon removed by each pixel is based on maps of forest type (e.g., mangrove, plantation), ecozone (e.g., humid Neotropics), forest age (e.g., primary, old secondary), and number of years of carbon removal. This layer reflects the cumulative removals during the model period (2001-2023) and must be divided by 23 to obtain an annual average during the model duration; removal rates cannot be assigned to individual years of the model.</p> <p>Forest carbon emissions represent the greenhouse gas emissions arising from stand-replacing forest disturbances that occurred in each modeled year (megagrams CO2 emissions/ha, between 2001 and 2022). Emissions include all relevant ecosystem carbon pools (aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, dead wood, litter, soil) and greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O). Emissions estimates for each pixel are calculated following IPCC Guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories where stand-replacing disturbance occurred, as mapped in the Global Forest Change annual tree cover loss data of Hansen et al. (2013). The carbon emitted from each pixel is based on carbon densities in 2000, with adjustment for carbon accumulated between 2000 and the year of disturbance. Emissions reflect a gross estimate, i.e., carbon removals from subsequent regrowth are not included. Instead, gross carbon removals resulting from subsequent regrowth after clearing are accounted for in the companion forest carbon removals layer. The fraction of carbon emitted from each pixel upon disturbance (emission factor) is affected by several factors, including the direct driver of disturbance, whether fire was observed in the year of or preceding the observed disturbance event,  whether the disturbance occurred on peat, and more. All emissions are assumed to occur in the year of disturbance. Emissions can be assigned to a specific year using the Hansen tree cover loss data.</p> <p>All three layers are part of the forest carbon flux model described in Harris et al. (2021). This paper introduces a geospatial monitoring framework for estimating global forest carbon fluxes which can assist governments and non-government actors with tracking greenhouse gas fluxes from forests and decreasing emissions or increasing removals by forests.

However, our understanding of surface water quality relies heavily on data from monitoring stations, which are spatially limited and temporally fragmented. Addressing these limitations, we introduce the dynamical surface water quality model (DynQual). This model offers simulations of water temperature (Tw), as well as concentrations of total dissolved solids (TDS), biological oxygen demand (BOD), and fecal coliform (FC). DynQual operates at a daily time step and boasts a spatial resolution of 5\u2009arcmin (\u223c\u200910\u2009km).</p> <p>This comprehensive global model allows us to evaluate its performance against real-world water quality observations. In addition, we present insights into spatial patterns and temporal trends of TDS, BOD, and FC concentrations spanning the years 1980 to 2019. Our analysis identifies dominant sectors contributing to surface water pollution. Remarkably, DynQual reveals widespread multi-pollutant hotspots, particularly in northern India and eastern China, though water quality issues extend across all regions worldwide. The most significant declines in water quality have occurred in developing regions, especially sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Researchers can access the open-source model code (Jones et al., 2023) as well as the global datasets encompassing simulated hydrology, Tw, TDS, BOD, and FC at 5\u2009arcmin resolution on a monthly basis (Jones et al., 2022b). These datasets hold the potential to enhance diverse studies ranging from ecological research to human health and water scarcity assessments.

You can read the full paper here</p> <p>The constituents, such as total dissolved solids (TDS), biological oxygen demand (BOD), and fecal coliform (FC), are concentrations. The routed versions of these constituents (routed_TDS, routed_BOD, and routed_FC) are masses of pollutants.

The majority of recent studies use land suitability for wind and solar, coupled with technical and socioeconomic constraints, as a proxy for actual location data. Here, we address this shortcoming. Using readily accessible OpenStreetMap data we present, to our knowledge, the first global, open-access, harmonised spatial datasets of wind and solar installations. We also include user friendly code to enable users to easily create newer versions of the dataset. Finally, we include first order estimates of power capacities of installations.

The new methodology (version 2.1) is a modification of the original VNL V1 that is available in the Earth Engine catalogue. Compared to VNL V1, this improved VNL V2.1 version removes ephemeral lights and background noise.</p> <p>In both methods there is an initial filtering to remove sunlit, moonlit and cloudy pixels, leading to rough composites that contains lights, fires, aurora and background. In the original method, the rough annual composites are made from a full year of nightly DNB data. In the new method, the rough composites are made on monthly increments and then combined to form rough annual composites. Both methods employ outlier removal to discard biomass burning pixels and isolate the background.</p> <p>In the original method the outlier removal is performed on scattergrams generated for each 15 arc second grid cell, with outliers clipped off from both the high and low radiance sides of the scattergram. The discard of outlier pixels proceeds until the scattergram\u2019s standard deviation stabilizes. The new method uses the twelve-month median radiance to discard high and low radiance outliers, filtering out most fires and isolating the background. Background areas are zeroed out in both methods using the data range (DR) calculated from 3x3 grid cells. In both methods, the DR threshold for background is indexed to cloud-cover levels, with higher DR thresholds in areas having low numbers of cloud-free coverages. In the new method, particular attention is given to setting a single DR threshold for distinguishing lit grid cells from background for each 15 arc second grid cell. This is achieved by setting the DR threshold from a multiyear maximum median and a corresponding multiyear percent cloud-cover grids. The multiyear approach makes it possible to detect lighting present in each 15 arc second grid cell with a single DR threshold across all the years in the series.

The FAO-PM is a predominately physically based approach, which can be used globally because it does not require estimations of additional site-specific parameters.

Low confidence daytime fire pixels are typically associated with areas of sun glint and lower relative temperature anomaly (&lt;15K) in the mid-infrared channel I4.

FRP Fire Radiative Power FRP depicts the pixel-integrated fire radiative power in MW (megawatts). FRP depicts the pixel-integrated fire radiative power in MW (megawatts). Given the unique spatial and spectral resolution of the data, the VIIRS 375 m fire detection algorithm was customized and tuned in order to optimize its response over small fires while balancing the occurrence of false alarms. Frequent saturation of the mid-infrared I4 channel (3.55-3.93 \u00b5m) driving the detection of active fires requires additional tests and procedures to avoid pixel classification errors. As a result, sub-pixel fire characterization (e.g., fire radiative power [FRP] retrieval) is only viable across small and/or low-intensity fires. Systematic FRP retrievals are based on a hybrid approach combining 375 and 750 m data. In fact, starting in 2015 the algorithm incorporated additional VIIRS channel M13 (3.973-4.128 \u00b5m) 750 m data in both aggregated and unaggregated format.

The location and extent of groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs) remain largely unknown in many regions, leading to inadequate protection measures. This dataset offers a high-resolution (approximately 30m) map of GDEs, revealing their presence on over one-third of the global drylands analyzed, including key biodiversity hotspots. GDEs are found to be more extensive and contiguous in areas dominated by pastoralism with lower groundwater depletion rates, indicating that many GDEs have likely already been lost due to unsustainable water and land use practices.</p> <p>About 53% of the mapped GDEs are located in regions experiencing declining groundwater trends, underscoring the urgent need for protective measures. Despite their importance, only 21% of GDEs are within protected areas or regions with sustainable groundwater management policies, highlighting a significant gap in conservation efforts. Additionally, this dataset explores the connection between GDEs and cultural, socio-economic factors in the Greater Sahel region, emphasizing their role in supporting biodiversity and rural livelihoods. The GDE map is a crucial tool for policymakers, conservationists, and stakeholders to prioritize and develop strategies for safeguarding these vital ecosystems at local, regional, and international levels.

The NASA GEDI is a spaceborne lidar instrument operating onboard the International Space Station since April 2019. It provides footprint-based measurements of vegetation structure, including forest canopy height between 52\u00b0N and 52\u00b0S globally. The Global Land Analysis and Discover team at the University of Maryland (UMD GLAD) integrated the GEDI data available to date (April-October 2019) with the year 2019 Landsat analysis-ready time-series data (Landsat ARD). The GEDI RH95 (relative height at 95%) metric was used to calibrate the model. The Landsat multi-temporal metrics that represent the surface phenology serve as the independent variables for global forest height modeling. The \u201cmoving window\u201d locally calibrated and applied bagged regression tree ensemble model was implemented to ensure high quality of forest height prediction and global map consistency. The model was extrapolated in the boreal regions (beyond the GLAD data range) to create the global forest height prototype map.</p> <p>The global forest height map is a prototype product that has known issues related to GEDI data quality and Landsat optical time-series data availability and feasibility of characterizing forest structure. GEDI data overestimate forest height on slopes within temperate and subtropical mountain grasslands, e.g. in New Zealand and Lesotho. Tree height over cities and suburbs may be confounded with building height, as GEDI data do not discriminate between the height of vegetation and man-made objects. The GEDI calibration uncertainties (specifically, geolocation precision and land surface height estimation) may be responsible for some of the map errors. The forest height model saturated above 30m and does not adequately represent the height of the tallest trees. The global product will be updated in the future to address most of the issues. The newly processed GEDI data will include refinements to land surface detection algorithms, an urban mask, and improved geolocation. Planned integration of higher spatial resolution Sentinel-2 data will allow the implementation of texture metrics. Application of advanced machine learning tools (namely, convolution neural networks) will be tested to improve forest height modeling accuracy.</p> <p>Map data within the GEDI data range provided in the geographic coordinates using the WGS84 reference system. 8-bit unsigned LZW-compressed GeoTiff.

It is based on the Fire Weather Index (FWI) System, the most widely used fire weather system in the world.

The moisture codes capture the moisture content of three generalized fuel classes and the behavior indices reflect the spread rate, fuel consumption and intensity of a fire if it were to start. Details on the development and testing of GFWED can be found in Field et al. (2015) and the evaluation of GFWED products in Field (2020a).

Developed using continuous change detection methods and leveraging the extensive Landsat imagery archives within the Google Earth Engine platform, GLC_FCS30D comprises 35 land-cover subcategories with 26 time steps, updated every five years prior to 2000 and annually thereafter. Through a rigorous refinement process, including spatiotemporal classification and temporal-consistency optimization, the dataset achieves high-confidence accuracy, validated with over 84,000 global samples and achieving an overall accuracy of 80.88%. Notably, GLC_FCS30D elucidates significant trends, revealing forest and cropland variations as dominant drivers of global land cover change over the past 37 years, with a net loss of approximately 2.5 million km\u00b2 of forests and a net gain of around 1.3 million km\u00b2 in cropland area. With its diverse classification system, high spatial resolution, and extensive temporal coverage, GLC_FCS30D serves as a valuable resource for climate change research and sustainable development analysis.

The Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) describes temporal anomalies in evapotranspiration (ET), highlighting areas with anomalously high or low rates of water use across the land surface. Here, ET is retrieved via energy balance using remotely sensed land-surface temperature (LST) time-change signals. LST is a fast- response variable, providing proxy information regarding rapidly evolving surface soil moisture and crop stress conditions at relatively high spatial resolution. The ESI also demonstrates capability for capturing early signals of \u201cflash drought\u201d, brought on by extended periods of hot, dry and windy conditions leading to rapid soil moisture depletion.

Also provided are (4) in situ field measurement data for selected sites across a wide variety of forest structures (e.g., scrub, fringe, riverine and basin) in mangrove ecotypes of the global equatorial region. Within designated plots, selected trees were identified to species and diameter at breast height (DBH) and tree height was measured using a laser rangefinder or clinometer.

The method involves using two estimators that work together to eliminate random noise and minimize the bias of Landsat spectral reflectances. The first estimator is an optimal interpolator that generates Landsat reflectance estimates using Landsat historical data and fused MODIS and Landsat reflectances from the nearest overpasses. The fusion process employs a linear regression model at a pixel level. The second estimator is a Kalman filter that corrects any bias in the reflectance produced by the first estimator. HISTARFM provides improved reflectance values and a unique and useful side product, the reflectance uncertainties, which is helpful for realistic error calculation (e.g., computing error bars of Vegetation Indexes or biophysical variables).

Values range from 1 to 1,427,688. Lake_name Name of lake or reservoir. This field is currently only populated for lakes with an area of at least 500 km2; for large reservoirs where a name was available in the GRanD database; and for smaller lakes where a name was available in the GLWD database. Country Country that the lake (or reservoir) is located in. International or transboundary lakes are assigned to the country in which its corresponding lake pour point is located and may be arbitrary for pour points that fall on country boundaries. Continent Continent that the lake (or reservoir) is located in. Geographic continent: Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, South America, or Oceania (Australia and Pacific Islands) Poly_src Source of original lake polygon: CanVec; SWBD; MODIS; NHD; ECRINS; GLWD; GRanD; or Other More information on these data sources can be found in Table 1. Lake_type Indicator for lake type: 1: Lake 2: Reservoir 3: Lake control (i.e. natural lake with regulation structure) Note that the default value for all water bodies is 1, and only those water bodies explicitly identified as other types (mostly based on information from the GRanD database) have other values; hence the type \u2018Lake\u2019 also includes all unidentified smaller human-made reservoirs and regulated lakes. Grand_id ID of the corresponding reservoir in the GRanD database, or value 0 for no corresponding GRanD record. This field can be used to join additional attributes from the GRanD database. Lake_area Lake surface area (i.e. polygon area), in square kilometers. Shore_len Length of shoreline (i.e. polygon outline), in kilometers. Shore_dev Shoreline development, measured as the ratio between shoreline length and the circumference of a circle with the same area. A lake with the shape of a perfect circle has a shoreline development of 1, while higher values indicate increasing shoreline complexity. Vol_total Total lake or reservoir volume, in million cubic meters (1 mcm = 0.001 km3). For most polygons, this value represents the total lake volume as estimated using the geostatistical modeling approach by Messager et al. (2016). However, where either a reported lake volume (for lakes \u2265 500 km2) or a reported reservoir volume (from GRanD database) existed, the total volume represents this reported value. In cases of regulated lakes, the total volume represents the larger value between reported reservoir and modeled or reported lake volume. Column \u2018Vol_src\u2019 provides additional information regarding these distinctions. Vol_res Reported reservoir volume, or storage volume of added lake regulation, in million cubic meters (1 mcm = 0.001 km3). 0: no reservoir volume Vol_src 1:  \u2018Vol_total\u2019 is the reported total lake volume from literature 2:  \u2018Vol_total\u2019 is the reported total reservoir volume from GRanD or literature 3:  \u2018Vol_total\u2019 is the estimated total lake volume using the geostatistical modeling approach by Messager et al. (2016) Depth_avg Average lake depth, in meters. Average lake depth is defined as the ratio between total lake volume (\u2018Vol_total\u2019) and lake area (\u2018Lake_area\u2019). Dis_avg Average long-term discharge flowing through the lake, in cubic meters per second. This value is derived from modeled runoff and discharge estimates provided by the global hydrological model WaterGAP, downscaled to the 15 arc-second resolution of HydroSHEDS (see section 2.2 for more details) and is extracted at the location of the lake pour point. Note that these model estimates contain considerable uncertainty, in particular for very low flows. -9999: no data as lake pour point is not on HydroSHEDS landmask Res_time Average residence time of the lake water, in days. The average residence time is calculated as the ratio between total lake volume (\u2018Vol_total\u2019) and average long-term discharge (\u2018Dis_avg\u2019). Values below 0.1 are rounded up to 0.1 as shorter residence times seem implausible (and likely indicate model errors). -1: cannot be calculated as \u2018Dis_avg\u2019 is 0 -9999: no data as lake pour point is not on HydroSHEDS landmask Elevation Elevation of lake surface, in meters above sea level. This value was primarily derived from the EarthEnv-DEM90 digital elevation model at 90 m pixel resolution by calculating the majority pixel elevation found within the lake boundaries. To remove some artefacts inherent in this DEM for northern latitudes, all lake values that showed negative elevation for the area north of 60\u00b0N were substituted with results using the coarser GTOPO30 DEM of USGS at 1 km pixel resolution, which ensures land surfaces \u22650 in this region. Note that due to the remaining uncertainties in the EarthEnv-DEM90 some small negative values occur along the global ocean coastline south of 60\u00b0N which may or may not be correct. Slope_100 Average slope within a 100 meter buffer around the lake polygon, in degrees. This value is derived from the EarthEnv-DEM90 digital elevation model at 90 m pixel resolution. Slopes for each pixel were computed with latitudinal corrections for the distortion in the XY spacing of geographic coordinates by approximating the geodesic distance between cell centers. For 12 lakes located above the northern limit of the EarthEnv-DEM90 digital elevation model (83\u00b0N), slopes were computed from the GTOPO30 DEM of USGS at 1 km pixel resolution. -1: slope values were not calculated for the largest lakes (polygon area \u2265 500 km2) Wshd_area Area of the watershed associated with the lake, in square kilometers.

Vulnerable carbon is the carbon that would be that would be released in a typical land-use conversion. Irrecoverable carbon is  the carbon that, if lost, would not recover by mid-century.

The study investigates the relationships between groundwater stress, aquifer depletion, and land subsidence on a worldwide scale. Employing remote sensing data and model-based datasets, a machine learning model has been developed to predict land subsidence at a remarkably high spatial resolution of approximately 2 kilometers. The outcomes of this study include a comprehensive estimation of global land subsidence magnitude, a first-order assessment of aquifer storage loss due to consolidation, and the quantification of key factors driving subsidence. Notably, a significant portion of the observed subsidence is concentrated in cropland and urban areas, underscoring the urgency of adopting sustainable groundwater management practices in these regions. This dataset is invaluable for understanding the spatial distribution of subsidence in both known and previously unidentified groundwater-stressed areas worldwide.</p> <p>The global land subsidence dataset is a pioneering effort in characterizing the complex interplay between groundwater dynamics, land subsidence, and aquifer storage loss. By leveraging machine learning and comprehensive datasets, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of the environmental challenges posed by excessive groundwater pumping and highlights the need for proactive measures to safeguard water resources and mitigate land subsidence impacts, particularly in regions facing water scarcity and population growth.

For example, natural and manmade disasters across the globe place vast populations at risk, often with little or no advance warning. It was critical to develop highly resolved estimates so that they were useful to evaluate to events across multiple geographic scales. This has been an annual product since 1998.</p> <p>Building on the modeling approach developed for LandScan Global, and taking advantage of higher quality data available for the U.S., we improved on both the spatial and the temporal resolution with our first version of LandScan USA in 2004. LandScan USA was created with the goal of capturing the diurnal variation of population that is critical for a variety of analyses and actions including emergency preparedness and response. In 2016, the original LandScan USA model was re-engineered to incoroporate advances in geospatial technology, machine learning approaches, and new input data sources. Since then, we have made annual improvements to the underlying model and released a new version of the dataset each year.</p> <p>Around the time LandScan USA was first initiated, ORNL was also pioneering work in machine learning and computer vision, specifically to identify anthropogenic signals apparent in overhead imagery. This work ultimately enabled rapid, large-scale detection of human settlements from high resolution imagery and became the basis for early efforts to develop an improved resolution population distribution outside the U.S. known as Landscan HD. LandScan HD model employs a mixture of multi-modal data fusion, spatial data science, big data resources, and satellite imagery exploitation. The first country-scale LandScan HD dataset was created in 2014 and a continuous stream of new country-scale datasets have been developed ever since.</p> <p>Disclaimer: Whole or parts of the dataset description were provided by the author(s) or their works.</p>"},{"location":"projects/landscan/#paper-citation","title":"Paper Citation","text":"<p>LandScan Global 2021 for other years find citation information here</p> <pre><code>Sims, K., Reith, A., Bright, E., McKee, J., &amp; Rose, A.

Cleared or harvested trees (i.e., clearcuts) will be mapped according to current cover (e.g., Barren, Grass/Shrub). Water Areas covered with water, such as streams, canals, lakes, reservoirs, bays, or oceans. Wetland Lands where water saturation is the determining factor in soil characteristics, vegetation types, and animal communities. Wetlands are composed of mosaics of water, bare soil, and herbaceous or wooded vegetated cover. Ice/Snow Land where accumulated snow and ice does not completely melt during the summer period (i.e., perennial ice/snow).

The datasets contain gridded fields and area averages of maximum, minimum, and mean temperature and precipitation amounts for the contiguous United States. NClimGrid consists of gridded fields covering the land area between approximately 24\u00b0N and 49\u00b0N and between 67\u00b0W and 125\u00b0W at a resolution of 1/24 of a degree (0.041667\u00b0). The primary purpose of these products is to support applications such as drought monitoring that require time series of spatially and/or temporally aggregated gridpoint values. Reliance on single-day values and individual points is discouraged due to the significant uncertainty that is inherent in such a product, as a result of the spatial distribution of the underlying observations, differences in observation time between neighboring stations, and interpolation errors. Spatial and temporal averaging tends to reduce the effect of these uncertainties, and time series of such aggregated values can be shown to be suitable for climatological applications.

It uses coarse census data and open geospatial data to create high-resolution population maps with a 100-meter ground sampling distance. POMELO can estimate populations even in regions lacking census data, achieving accuracy in sub-Saharan Africa experiments. It evaluates performance in three scenarios: coarse supervision, fine supervision, and transfer tasks, highlighting the practicality of fine supervision. POMELO estimates building occupancy rates and computes populations by multiplying them with building counts. It relies on free sources like the Open Buildings dataset but acknowledges potential errors. Dependence on high-resolution images and data availability is a concern. Crowdsourced data is essential in data-scarce regions. POMELO uses various geospatial data layers, with nightlight and settlement layers being predictive. Future improvements may include additional covariates from open geospatial sources, but handling incomplete and biased data remains a challenge. This dataset presents a fine-grained population map of Tanzania, Mozambique, Uganda, Zambia, and Rwanda with a resolution of 100 meters for 2020, generated using the POMELO super-resolution technique that is based on deep learning. Please refer to our Nature Scientific Reports publication for more details. Each pixel contains a floating point number specifying the number of inhabitants of the respective pixel (i.e. People/100m).</p> <p>Traditionally, many countries, including those in sub-Saharan Africa, rely on aggregated census data over expansive spatial units, which are not always timely or accurate. The need for detailed population maps is paramount in several sectors, including urban development, environmental supervision, public health, and humanitarian initiatives.

The framework, known as Quantile Loss Domain Adversarial Neural Networks (QDANN), utilizes knowledge from county-level datasets to accurately map yields at finer spatial resolutions, addressing the limitations posed by the scarcity of ground truth data for model training and evaluation.While broader scale yield mapping (e.g., state or county level) has become standard, finer-scale mapping has faced challenges due to the lack of subfield yield information. QDANN employs an unsupervised domain adaptation strategy, training on labeled county-level data while leveraging unlabeled subfield data, thus eliminating the need for yield information at the subfield level.</p> <p>The dataset is based on Landsat imagery and Gridmet weather data, focusing on maize, soybean, and winter wheat fields across the United States. It is validated using yield monitor records from approximately one million field-year observations. QDANN's performance is benchmarked against various process-based and machine learning methods that utilize simulated yield records or county-level data.</p> <p>Key results include: - R\u00b2 scores (RMSE) for maize, soybean, and winter wheat were 48% (2.29 t/ha), 32% (0.85 t/ha), and 39% (1.40 t/ha) respectively, demonstrating superior accuracy compared to benchmark methods. - When yields were aggregated to the county level, QDANN's performance improved significantly, achieving R\u00b2 scores (RMSE) of 78% (0.98 t/ha) for maize, 62% (0.37 t/ha) for soybean, and 53% (1.00 t/ha) for winter wheat.</p> <p>This study illustrates the efficacy of the QDANN framework for reliable yield mapping at subfield levels, even in the absence of fine-scale yield data. The dataset includes publicly available 30-meter annual yield maps for major crop-producing states in the U.S., generated since 2008 with units kg/ha.

The World Bank has since endorsed an additional Research for Community Access Partnership (ReCAP) funded project led by the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL)\u2014the RAI Supplemental Guidelines (Workman and McPherson, 2019)\u2014which provided detailed guidance for calculating the RAI, notably with an alternative approach to the all-season aspect of RAI, focusing on the changing accessibility profile of road networks rather than relying on road surface quality alone or scarce physical measurements for road conditions. Nevertheless, neither the 2016 nor the 2019 methodologies were implemented globally, with official implementations published by the World Bank being restricted to more in-depth studies for selected countries mostly in Africa and the Middle East (World Bank, 2023a) due to data source restrictions.</p> <p></p> <p>Here the SDG Transformation Center, part of the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network (UN SDSN), seeks to fill in this gap by implementing the most up-to-date methodology endorsed by the World Bank\u2019s (World Bank\u2019s 2016 methodology supplemented by TRL\u2019s 2019 guidelines) at global scale with free remotely sensed datasets with global coverage.

Globally, coastlines average one delta for every \u223c300\u2009km of shoreline, but there are hotspots of delta formation, for example in Southeast Asia where there is one delta per 100\u2009km of shoreline. Our analysis shows that the likelihood of a river to form a delta increases with increasing water discharge, sediment discharge, and drainage basin area. On the other hand, delta likelihood decreases with increasing wave height and tidal range. Delta likelihood has a non-monotonic relationship with receiving-basin slope: it decreases with steeper slopes, but for slopes\u2009&gt;0.006 delta likelihood increases.

Polygon topology was applied to the GSV, resulting in a new characterisation of the number and size of global islands. Three size classes of islands were mapped: continental mainlands (5), islands greater than 1\u2005km2 (21,818), and islands smaller than 1\u2005km2 (318,868). The GSV represents the shore zone land and water interface boundary, and is a spatially explicit ecological domain separator between terrestrial and marine environments. The development and characteristics of the GSV are presented herein. An approach is also proposed for delineating standardised, high spatial resolution global ecological coastal units (ECUs). For this coastal ecosystem mapping effort, the GSV will be used to separate the nearshore coastal waters from the onshore coastal lands.

To maximize the utility and flexibility of this data, the SWOT mission delivers a variety of data products, including river vector data in shapefile format for each SWOT overpass. These vector products offer immense potential for multi-temporal analysis of river systems, allowing researchers to track changes in river characteristics over time.</p> <p>To enable this type of analysis, it was crucial to define consistent river reaches and nodes before the launch of SWOT. This ensures that data from different overpasses can be accurately assigned and compared. The SWOT River Database (SWORD) fulfills this critical role by combining multiple global datasets related to rivers and satellite observations. SWORD provides a standardized framework of high-resolution river nodes (spaced every 200 meters along river centerlines) and reaches (river segments of approximately 10 kilometers) in both shapefile and netCDF formats. These nodes and reaches are accompanied by a range of relevant hydrologic variables such as water surface elevation, width, slope, and information on river obstructions, flow accumulation, and more. This comprehensive dataset, covering global rivers 30 meters wide and greater, empowers researchers to conduct in-depth analysis of river systems and utilize SWOT data to its full potential.</p> <p>SWORD integrates data from several existing global hydrography datasets, including the Global River Widths from Landsat (GRWL), MERIT Hydro, HydroBASINS, and the Global River Obstruction Database (GROD).

The effect of tile drainage on crop production, hydrology, and the environment on a regional scale is elusive due to lack of high-resolution, spatially-explicit tile drainage area information for the Contiguous United States (CONUS). We developed a 30-m resolution tile drainage map of the most-likely tile-drained area of the CONUS (AgTile-US) from county-level tile drainage census using a geospatial model that uses soil drainage information and topographic slope as inputs. Validation of AgTile-US with 16000 ground truth points indicated 86.03% accuracy at the CONUS-scale. Over the heavily tile-drained midwestern regions of the U.S., the accuracy ranges from 82.7% to 93.6%.

However, whether NT systems are as productive as those relying on conventional tillage (CT) is a controversial issue, fraught by a high variability over time and space. Here, we expand existing datasets to include the results of the most recent field experiments, and we produce a global dataset comparing the crop yields obtained under CT and NT systems. In addition to crop yield, our dataset also reports information on crop growing season, management practices, soil characteristics and key climate parameters throughout the experimental year. The final dataset contains 4403 paired yield observations between 1980 and 2017 for eight major staple crops in 50 countries. This dataset can help to gain insight into the main drivers explaining the variability of the productivity of NT and the consequence of its adoption on crop yields.</p>"},{"location":"projects/tillage/#data-citation","title":"Data Citation","text":"<pre><code>Su, Y., Gabrielle, B. &amp; Makowski, D.

Traditional methods of estimating UHI intensity (UHII) have been constrained by limitations, such as focusing solely on clear-sky surface UHII and neglecting all-sky surface and canopy (air temperature) UHII. These approaches often overlook anthropogenic disturbances, leading to uncertainties in the estimates. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces a new dynamic equal-area (DEA) method designed to reduce the impact of confounding factors through a dynamic cyclic process. By applying the DEA method and integrating gridded temperature data, a comprehensive global-scale UHII dataset has been developed, covering over 10,000 cities and spanning more than 20 years with monthly temporal resolution. This dataset offers multi-faceted UHII estimates, including clear-sky surface, all-sky surface, and canopy UHII, providing a robust foundation for analyzing UHI trends in urban environments.</p> <p>The dataset reveals that UHII is greater than zero in more than 80% of the studied cities, with global annual average magnitudes around 1.0\u00b0C (day) and 0.8\u00b0C (night) for surface UHII, and approximately 0.5\u00b0C for canopy UHII. Moreover, an interannual upward trend in UHII is observed in over 60% of cities, with global average trends exceeding 0.1\u00b0C per decade (day) and 0.06\u00b0C per decade (night) for surface UHII, and slightly over 0.03\u00b0C per decade for canopy UHII. A positive correlation is also identified between the magnitude and trend of UHII, indicating that cities with stronger UHII tend to experience faster growth in UHII over time. The dataset further highlights discrepancies in UHII estimates based on differences in data types (surface or air temperature), data acquisition times (Terra or Aqua), weather conditions (clear-sky or all-sky), and processing methodologies. This comprehensive dataset and the accompanying analysis offer valuable insights for future urban climate studies and are publicly accessible at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.24821538.

If \u201cMonth\u201d is between 21 and 24, it indicates the quarterly average (21 for March-May, 22 for June-August, 23 for September-November, and 24 for         December-February).

Built upon the foundations of the Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEB) approach, initially proposed by Senay et al. in 2007 and further refined in subsequent publications (Senay et al., 2011), the SSEBop model features unique parameterization specifically tailored for operational applications, akin to principles associated with psychrometry.

Additionally, reference ET values are obtained through global data assimilation systems (GDAS) for calibration and validation purposes, further enhancing the accuracy of this dataset.

Object-based image analysis techniques (OBIA) were employed to extract land cover information using the best available remotely sensed and vector GIS datasets. OBIA systems work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties, while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets. Within the OBIA environment a rule-based expert system was designed to effectively mimic the process of manual image analysis by incorporating the elements of image interpretation (color/tone, texture, pattern, location, size, and shape) into the classification process.

Because areas of high population density and growth (high vulnerability) are generally associated with urban areas that have lower levels of poverty and higher degrees of adaptive capacity (low vulnerability), to some degree, the population factors cancel out the poverty and adaptive capacity indicators. To account for this, the data set includes two sub-indices, a Population Exposure Index (PEI), which only includes population density and population growth; and a Poverty and Adaptive Capacity Index (PACI), composed of subnational poverty, maternal education levels, market accessibility, and conflict. These sub-indices are able to isolate the population indicators from the poverty and conflict metrics.
