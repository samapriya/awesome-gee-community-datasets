These time-series land cover maps were produced from annual time-series of Landsat image composites, forest change information, and ancillary topographic and hydrologic data following the framework described in Hermosilla et al. (2022), which builds upon the approach introduced in Hermosilla et al. (2018). The methodological innovations included (i) a refined training pool derived from existing land cover products using airborne and spaceborne measures of forest structure; (ii) selection of training samples proportionally to the land cover distribution using a distance=weighted approach; and (iii) generation of regional classification models using a 150x150 km tiling system. Maps are post-processed using disturbance information to ensure logical class transitions over time using a Hidden Markov Model. Hidden Markov Models assess individual year class likelihoods to reduce variability and possible noise in year-on-year class assignments (for instances when class likelihoods are similar). For an overview on the data, image processing, and time series change detection methods applied, as well as information on independent accuracy assessment of the data, see Hermosilla et al.

An image compositing window of August 1 -30 days was used to generate the best-available-pixel (BAP) image composites used as the source data for land cover classification.

These time-series land cover maps were produced from annual time-series of Landsat image composites, forest change information, and ancillary topographic and hydrologic data following the framework described in Hermosilla et al. (2022), which builds upon the approach introduced in Hermosilla et al. (2018). The methodological innovations included (i) a refined training pool derived from existing land cover products using airborne and spaceborne measures of forest structure; (ii) selection of training samples proportionally to the land cover distribution using a distance=weighted approach; and (iii) generation of regional classification models using a 150x150 km tiling system. Maps are post-processed using disturbance information to ensure logical class transitions over time using a Hidden Markov Model. Hidden Markov Models assess individual year class likelihoods to reduce variability and possible noise in year-on-year class assignments (for instances when class likelihoods are similar).

Geospatially explicit and, ideally, highly resolved information is required to manage terrestrial ecosystems, mitigate climate change, and prevent biodiversity loss. Here, we present the first global, wall-to-wall canopy height map at 10 m ground sampling distance for the year 2020. No single data source meets these requirements: dedicated space missions like GEDI deliver sparse height data, with unprecedented coverage, whereas optical satellite images like Sentinel-2 offer dense observations globally, but cannot directly measure vertical structures. By fusing GEDI with Sentinel-2, we have developed a probabilistic deep learning model to retrieve canopy height from Sentinel-2 images anywhere on Earth, and to quantify the uncertainty in these estimates. The presented approach reduces the saturation effect commonly encountered when estimating canopy height from satellite images, allowing to resolve tall canopies with likely high carbon stocks. According to our map, only 5% of the global landmass is covered by trees taller than 30 m. Such data play an important role for conservation, e.g., we find that only 34% of these tall canopies are located within protected areas. Our model enables consistent, uncertainty-informed worldwide mapping and supports an ongoing monitoring to detect change and inform decision making.

The timeframe for this metadata is summer 2016. These maps are developed utilizing high resolution National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) imagery, and can be used to track changes in the landscape through time. This trend information gives important feedback to managers on the success or failure of management policies and programs and aid in developing a scientific understanding of the Earth system and its response to natural and human-induced changes. This understanding allows for the prediction of impacts due to these changes and the assessment of their cumulative effects, helping coastal resource managers make more informed regional decisions. NOAA C-CAP is a contributing member to the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics consortium and C-CAP products are included as the coastal expression of land cover within the National Land Cover Database. These detailed products bring NOAA\u2019s national land cover mapping framework to the local level and are developed for specific project-based geographies (not the entire coastal land cover mapping boundary).

Net carbon flux is calculated by subtracting average annual gross removals from average annual gross emissions in each modeled pixel; negative values are where forests were net sinks of carbon and positive values are where forests were net sources of carbon between 2001 and 2021. Net fluxes are calculated following IPCC Guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories in each pixel where forests existed in 2000 or were established between 2000 and 2012 according to the Global Forest Change tree cover change data of Hansen et al. (2013). This layer reflects the cumulative net flux during the model period (2001-2021) and must be divided by 21 to obtain average annual net flux; net flux values cannot be assigned to individual years of the model. Forest carbon removals from the atmosphere (sequestration) by forest sinks represent the cumulative carbon captured (megagrams CO2/ha) by the growth of established and newly regrowing forests during the model period between 2001-2021. Removals include accumulation of carbon in both aboveground and belowground live tree biomass. Following IPCC Tier 1 assumptions for forests remaining forests, removals by dead wood, litter, and soil carbon pools are assumed to be zero. In each pixel, carbon removals are calculated following IPCC Guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories where forests existed in 2000 or were established between 2000 and 2012 according to the Global Forest Change tree cover loss data of Hansen et al. (2013). Carbon removed by each pixel is based on maps of forest type (e.g., mangrove, plantation), ecozone (e.g., humid Neotropics), forest age (e.g., primary, old secondary), and number of years of carbon removal. This layer reflects the cumulative removals during the model period (2001-2021) and must be divided by 21 to obtain an annual average during the model duration; removal rates cannot be assigned to individual years of the model. Forest carbon emissions represent the greenhouse gas emissions arising from stand-replacing forest disturbances that occurred in each modeled year (megagrams CO2 emissions/ha, between 2001 and 2021). Emissions include all relevant ecosystem carbon pools (aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, dead wood, litter, soil) and greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O). Emissions estimates for each pixel are calculated following IPCC Guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories where stand-replacing disturbance occurred, as mapped in the Global Forest Change annual tree cover loss data of Hansen et al. (2013). The carbon emitted from each pixel is based on carbon densities in 2000, with adjustment for carbon accumulated between 2000 and the year of disturbance. Emissions reflect a gross estimate, i.e., carbon removals from subsequent regrowth are not included. Instead, gross carbon removals resulting from subsequent regrowth after clearing are accounted for in the companion forest carbon removals layer. The fraction of carbon emitted from each pixel upon disturbance (emission factor) is affected by several factors, including the direct driver of disturbance, whether fire was observed in the year of or preceding the observed disturbance event, whether the disturbance occurred on peat, and more. All emissions are assumed to occur in the year of disturbance. Emissions can be assigned to a specific year using the Hansen tree cover loss data.

Net carbon flux is calculated by subtracting average annual gross removals from average annual gross emissions in each modeled pixel; negative values are where forests were net sinks of carbon and positive values are where forests were net sources of carbon between 2001 and 2021. Net fluxes are calculated following IPCC Guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories in each pixel where forests existed in 2000 or were established between 2000 and 2012 according to the Global Forest Change tree cover change data of Hansen et al. (2013). This layer reflects the cumulative net flux during the model period (2001-2021) and must be divided by 21 to obtain average annual net flux; net flux values cannot be assigned to individual years of the model. Forest carbon removals from the atmosphere (sequestration) by forest sinks represent the cumulative carbon captured (megagrams CO2/ha) by the growth of established and newly regrowing forests during the model period between 2001-2021. Removals include accumulation of carbon in both aboveground and belowground live tree biomass. Following IPCC Tier 1 assumptions for forests remaining forests, removals by dead wood, litter, and soil carbon pools are assumed to be zero. In each pixel, carbon removals are calculated following IPCC Guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories where forests existed in 2000 or were established between 2000 and 2012 according to the Global Forest Change tree cover loss data of Hansen et al. (2013). Carbon removed by each pixel is based on maps of forest type (e.g., mangrove, plantation), ecozone (e.g., humid Neotropics), forest age (e.g., primary, old secondary), and number of years of carbon removal. This layer reflects the cumulative removals during the model period (2001-2021) and must be divided by 21 to obtain an annual average during the model duration; removal rates cannot be assigned to individual years of the model. Forest carbon emissions represent the greenhouse gas emissions arising from stand-replacing forest disturbances that occurred in each modeled year (megagrams CO2 emissions/ha, between 2001 and 2021). Emissions include all relevant ecosystem carbon pools (aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, dead wood, litter, soil) and greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O). Emissions estimates for each pixel are calculated following IPCC Guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories where stand-replacing disturbance occurred, as mapped in the Global Forest Change annual tree cover loss data of Hansen et al. (2013). The carbon emitted from each pixel is based on carbon densities in 2000, with adjustment for carbon accumulated between 2000 and the year of disturbance. Emissions reflect a gross estimate, i.e., carbon removals from subsequent regrowth are not included. Instead, gross carbon removals resulting from subsequent regrowth after clearing are accounted for in the companion forest carbon removals layer. The fraction of carbon emitted from each pixel upon disturbance (emission factor) is affected by several factors, including the direct driver of disturbance, whether fire was observed in the year of or preceding the observed disturbance event, whether the disturbance occurred on peat, and more. All emissions are assumed to occur in the year of disturbance. Emissions can be assigned to a specific year using the Hansen tree cover loss data. All three layers are part of the forest carbon flux model described in Harris et al. (2021) .

Among several equations to estimate PET, a FAO application of the Penman-Monteith equation (Allen et al. 1998), here referred as FAOPM, is currently widely considered as a standard method (Walter et al. 2000). The FAO introduced the definition of PET as the ET of a reference crop (ET0) under optimal conditions, having the characteristics of well-watered grass with an assumed height of 12 centimeters, a fixed surface resistance of 70 seconds per meter and an albedo of 0.23 (Allen et al. 1998). The FAO-PM is a predominately physically based approach, which can be used globally because it does not require estimations of additional site-specific parameters. However, a major drawback of the FAO-PM method is its relatively high need for specific data for a variety of parameters (i.e. windspeed, relative humidity, solar radiation, etc.).

The 375 m data complements Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) fire detection; they both show good agreement in hotspot detection but the improved spatial resolution of the 375 m data provides a greater response over fires of relatively small areas and provides improved mapping of large fire perimeters. The 375 m data also has improved nighttime performance. Consequently, these data are well suited for use in support of fire management (e.g., near real-time alert systems), as well as other science applications requiring improved fire mapping fidelity.

Low confidence daytime fire pixels are typically associated with areas of sun glint and lower relative temperature anomaly (<15K) in the mid-infrared channel I4.

Given the unique spatial and spectral resolution of the data, the VIIRS 375 m fire detection algorithm was customized and tuned in order to optimize its response over small fires while balancing the occurrence of false alarms. Frequent saturation of the mid-infrared I4 channel (3.55-3.93 \u00b5m) driving the detection of active fires requires additional tests and procedures to avoid pixel classification errors. As a result, sub-pixel fire characterization (e.g., fire radiative power [FRP] retrieval) is only viable across small and/or low-intensity fires. Systematic FRP retrievals are based on a hybrid approach combining 375 and 750 m data.

The database contains 3,117 cement plants with exact geolocation and provides information about ownership, production type, plant type, capacity and production start year where available. The process consists of three steps: the mixing of limestone with other materials; the heating of the limestone mixture to produce clinker and the grinding of clinker with different ingredients to produce cement. The grinding process can happen in integrated facilities where the clinker is also produced or in independent grinding facilities closer to its end market. While the bulk of greenhouse gas emissions associated with cement production stem from clinker production and integrated facilities, the database covers both integrated as well as independent grinding facilities.

The database contains 3,117 cement plants with exact geolocation and provides information about ownership, production type, plant type, capacity and production start year where available. The process consists of three steps: the mixing of limestone with other materials; the heating of the limestone mixture to produce clinker and the grinding of clinker with different ingredients to produce cement. The grinding process can happen in integrated facilities where the clinker is also produced or in independent grinding facilities closer to its end market. While the bulk of greenhouse gas emissions associated with cement production stem from clinker production and integrated facilities, the database covers both integrated as well as independent grinding facilities.","title":"Global Database of Cement Production Assets"},{"location":"projects/gcd/#citation","text":"McCarten, M., Bayaraa, M., Caldecott, B., Christiaen, C., Foster, P., Hickey, C., Kampmann, D., Layman, C., Rossi, C., Scott, K., Tang, K., Tkachenko, N., and Yoken, D. 2021.

The GEBCO_2021 Grid provides global coverage of elevation data in meters on a 15 arc-second grid of 43200 rows x 86400 columns, giving 3,732,480,000 data points. The GEBCO_2021 Grid is a continuous, global terrain model for ocean and land with a spatial resolution of 15 arc seconds. The grid uses as a \u2018base\u2019 Version 2 of the SRTM15+ data set (Tozer et al, 2019). This data set is a fusion of land topography with measured and estimated seafloor topography. It is augmented with the gridded bathymetric data sets developed by the four Seabed 2030 Regional Centers. The Regional Centers have compiled gridded bathymetric data sets, largely based on multibeam data, for their areas of responsibility. These regional grids were then provided to the Global Center. For areas outside of the polar regions (primarily south of 60\u00b0N and north of 50\u00b0S), these data sets are in the form of 'sparse grids', i.e. only grid cells that contain data were populated. For the polar regions, complete grids were provided due to the complexities of incorporating data held in polar coordinates. The compilation of the GEBCO_2021 Grid from these regional data grids was carried out at the Global Center, with the aim of producing a seamless global terrain model. The GEBCO_2021 Grid includes data sets from a number of international and national data repositories and regional mapping initiatives. For information on the data sets included in the GEBCO_2021 Grid, please see the list of contributions included in this release of the grid.

The GEBCO_2021 Grid provides global coverage of elevation data in meters on a 15 arc-second grid of 43200 rows x 86400 columns, giving 3,732,480,000 data points. The GEBCO_2021 Grid is a continuous, global terrain model for ocean and land with a spatial resolution of 15 arc seconds. The grid uses as a \u2018base\u2019 Version 2 of the SRTM15+ data set (Tozer et al, 2019). This data set is a fusion of land topography with measured and estimated seafloor topography. It is augmented with the gridded bathymetric data sets developed by the four Seabed 2030 Regional Centers. The Regional Centers have compiled gridded bathymetric data sets, largely based on multibeam data, for their areas of responsibility. These regional grids were then provided to the Global Center. For areas outside of the polar regions (primarily south of 60\u00b0N and north of 50\u00b0S), these data sets are in the form of 'sparse grids', i.e. only grid cells that contain data were populated. For the polar regions, complete grids were provided due to the complexities of incorporating data held in polar coordinates. The compilation of the GEBCO_2021 Grid from these regional data grids was carried out at the Global Center, with the aim of producing a seamless global terrain model. The GEBCO_2021 Grid includes data sets from a number of international and national data repositories and regional mapping initiatives. For information on the data sets included in the GEBCO_2021 Grid, please see the list of contributions included in this release of the grid.","title":"General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO)"},{"location":"projects/gebco/#data-citation-attribution","text":"GEBCO Compilation Group (2021) GEBCO 2021 Grid (doi:10.5285/c6612cbe-50b3-0cff-e053-6c86abc09f8f)","title":"Data Citation &amp; Attribution"},{"location":"projects/gebco/#earth-engine-snippet","text":"var gebco_grid = ee .

Data are available in easily accessible GIS-layers and can also be explored online here and a detailed description of the underlying methodology is provided by Andela et al. (2019). The data provide unique insights in the environmental conditions that give rise to the world's most extreme wildfires. The world's largest wildfires were found in sparsely populated arid and semiarid grasslands and shrublands of interior Australia, Africa, and Central Asia. Strikingly, fires of these proportions were nearly absent in similar ecosystems of North and South America, possibly due to higher landscape fragmentation and different management practices, including active fire suppression. While the world's largest fires occurred in more arid ecosystems, the longest fires burned for over 2 months in seasonal regions of the humid tropics and high-latitude forests. In these sparsely populated high fuel-load systems fires can continuously burn as long as weather conditions are favorable. Abnormal weather conditions often synchronized the occurrence of multiple extreme wildfires across larger regions. Global patterns of fire velocity were reversely related to fuel loads, and the highest fire velocities typically occurred in areas of low fuel loads. Citation \u00b6 Andela, Niels, Douglas C.

We delineated the sub-catchment for each grid cell along the HydroSHEDS river network and summarized the upstream environment (climate, topography, land cover, surface geology and soil) to each grid cell using various metrics (average, minimum, maximum, range, sum, inverse distance-weighted average and sum). All variables were subsequently averaged across single lakes and reservoirs of the Global lakes and Wetlands Database that are connected to the river network. Monthly climate variables were summarized into 19 long-term climatic variables following the \u201cbioclim\u201d framework.","title":"Global Freshwater Variables"},{"location":"projects/gfv/#paper-citation","text":"Domisch, S., Amatulli, G., and Jetz, W.

Estimates of (1) mangrove aboveground biomass (AGB), (2) maximum canopy height (height of the tallest tree), and (3) basal-area weighted height (individual tree heights weighted in proportion to their basal area) for the nominal year 2000 were derived across a 30-meter resolution global mangrove ecotype extent map using remotely-sensed canopy height measurements and region-specific allometric models. Also provided are (4) in situ field measurement data for selected sites across a wide variety of forest structures (e.g., scrub, fringe, riverine and basin) in mangrove ecotypes of the global equatorial region. Within designated plots, selected trees were identified to species and diameter at breast height (DBH) and tree height was measured using a laser rangefinder or clinometer. Tree density (the number of stems) can be estimated for each plot and expressed per unit area. These data were used to derive plot-level allometry among AGB, basal area weighted height (Hba), and maximum canopy height (Hmax) and to validate the remotely sensed estimates. Spatially explicit maps of mangrove canopy height and AGB derived from space-borne remote sensing data and in situ measurements can be used to assess local-scale geophysical and environmental conditions that may regulate forest structure and carbon cycle dynamics. Maps revealed a wide range of canopy heights, including maximum values (> 62 m) that surpass maximum heights of other forest types.

Remotely sensed observations can provide insights into historical urban dynamics, but only during the satellite era. Here, we develop a 1\u2009km resolution global dataset of annual urban dynamics between 1870 and 2100 using an urban cellular automata model trained on satellite observations of urban extent between 1992 and 2013. Hindcast (1870\u20131990) and projected (2020\u20132100) urban dynamics under the five Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) were modeled. We find that global urban growth under SSP5, the fossil-fuelled development scenario, was largest with a greater than 40-fold increase in urban extent since 1870. The high resolution dataset captures grid level urban sprawl over 200 years, which can provide insights into the urbanization life cycle of cities and help assess long-term environmental impacts of urbanization and human\u2013environment interactions at a global scale.

On a 250 m grid, there is a local wind climate estimate for every node. Power density data takes into account geographical variations of air density.

Surface roughness length is a property of the surface which can be used to determine the way the horizontal wind speed varies with height.

Rapid Response Crop Maps in Data Sparse Regions \u00b6 We present a method for rapid mapping of croplands in regions where little to no ground data is available. We present results for this method in Togo, where we delivered a high-resolution (10 m) cropland map in under 10 days to facilitate rapid response to the COVID-19 pandemic by the Togolese government. This demonstrated a successful transition of machine learning applications research to operational rapid response in a real humanitarian crisis.

In this work, we present a new method that uses an autoregressive LSTM to classify cropland during the growing season (i.e., partially-observed time series). We used these methods to produce publicly-available 10m-resolution cropland maps in Kenya for the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 growing seasons. These are the highest-resolution and most recent cropland maps publicly available for Kenya.

This release has made it possible for FutureWater to update its HiHydroSoil v1.2 database with newer, more precise and with a higher resolution soil data, which resulted in the development and release of HiHydroSoil v2.0. Soil information is the basis for all environmental studies. Since local soil maps of good quality are often not available, global soil maps with a low resolution are used. Furthermore, soil maps do not include information about soil hydraulic properties, which are of importance in, for example, hydrological modeling, erosion assessment and crop yield modelling. HiHydroSoil v2.0 can fill this data gap.

The HydroATLAS database is divided into three distinct sub-datasets: BasinATLAS, RiverATLAS, and LakeATLAS which represent sub-basin delineations (polygons), the river network (lines), and lake shorelines (polygons), respectively. In total, HydroATLAS contains 1.0 million sub-basins, 8.5 million river reaches, and 1.4 million lakes. HydroATLAS has been created by compiling and re-formatting a wide range of hydro-environmental attributes derived from existing global datasets in a consistent and organized manner. The resulting data compendium offers attributes grouped in seven categories: hydrology; physiography; climate; land cover & use; soils & geology; and anthropogenic influences. For each of the three sub-datasets, HydroATLAS contains 56 hydro-environmental variables, partitioned into 281 individual attributes. You can download the files here The HydroATLAS database is distributed in large file sizes due to the enriched attribute information.

Values range from 1 to 1,427,688. Lake_name Name of lake or reservoir. This field is currently only populated for lakes with an area of at least 500 km2; for large reservoirs where a name was available in the GRanD database; and for smaller lakes where a name was available in the GLWD database. Country Country that the lake (or reservoir) is located in. International or transboundary lakes are assigned to the country in which its corresponding lake pour point is located and may be arbitrary for pour points that fall on country boundaries. Continent Continent that the lake (or reservoir) is located in. Geographic continent: Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, South America, or Oceania (Australia and Pacific Islands) Poly_src Source of original lake polygon: CanVec; SWBD; MODIS; NHD; ECRINS; GLWD; GRanD; or Other More information on these data sources can be found in Table 1. Lake_type Indicator for lake type: 1: Lake 2: Reservoir 3: Lake control (i.e. natural lake with regulation structure) Note that the default value for all water bodies is 1, and only those water bodies explicitly identified as other types (mostly based on information from the GRanD database) have other values; hence the type \u2018Lake\u2019 also includes all unidentified smaller human-made reservoirs and regulated lakes. Grand_id ID of the corresponding reservoir in the GRanD database, or value 0 for no corresponding GRanD record. This field can be used to join additional attributes from the GRanD database. Lake_area Lake surface area (i.e. polygon area), in square kilometers. Shore_len Length of shoreline (i.e. polygon outline), in kilometers. Shore_dev Shoreline development, measured as the ratio between shoreline length and the circumference of a circle with the same area. A lake with the shape of a perfect circle has a shoreline development of 1, while higher values indicate increasing shoreline complexity. Vol_total Total lake or reservoir volume, in million cubic meters (1 mcm = 0.001 km3). For most polygons, this value represents the total lake volume as estimated using the geostatistical modeling approach by Messager et al. (2016). However, where either a reported lake volume (for lakes \u2265 500 km2) or a reported reservoir volume (from GRanD database) existed, the total volume represents this reported value. In cases of regulated lakes, the total volume represents the larger value between reported reservoir and modeled or reported lake volume. Column \u2018Vol_src\u2019 provides additional information regarding these distinctions. Vol_res Reported reservoir volume, or storage volume of added lake regulation, in million cubic meters (1 mcm = 0.001 km3). 0: no reservoir volume Vol_src 1: \u2018Vol_total\u2019 is the reported total lake volume from literature 2: \u2018Vol_total\u2019 is the reported total reservoir volume from GRanD or literature 3: \u2018Vol_total\u2019 is the estimated total lake volume using the geostatistical modeling approach by Messager et al. (2016) Depth_avg Average lake depth, in meters. Average lake depth is defined as the ratio between total lake volume (\u2018Vol_total\u2019) and lake area (\u2018Lake_area\u2019). Dis_avg Average long-term discharge flowing through the lake, in cubic meters per second. This value is derived from modeled runoff and discharge estimates provided by the global hydrological model WaterGAP, downscaled to the 15 arc-second resolution of HydroSHEDS (see section 2.2 for more details) and is extracted at the location of the lake pour point. Note that these model estimates contain considerable uncertainty, in particular for very low flows. -9999: no data as lake pour point is not on HydroSHEDS landmask Res_time Average residence time of the lake water, in days. The average residence time is calculated as the ratio between total lake volume (\u2018Vol_total\u2019) and average long-term discharge (\u2018Dis_avg\u2019). Values below 0.1 are rounded up to 0.1 as shorter residence times seem implausible (and likely indicate model errors). -1: cannot be calculated as \u2018Dis_avg\u2019 is 0 -9999: no data as lake pour point is not on HydroSHEDS landmask Elevation Elevation of lake surface, in meters above sea level. This value was primarily derived from the EarthEnv-DEM90 digital elevation model at 90 m pixel resolution by calculating the majority pixel elevation found within the lake boundaries. To remove some artefacts inherent in this DEM for northern latitudes, all lake values that showed negative elevation for the area north of 60\u00b0N were substituted with results using the coarser GTOPO30 DEM of USGS at 1 km pixel resolution, which ensures land surfaces \u22650 in this region. Note that due to the remaining uncertainties in the EarthEnv-DEM90 some small negative values occur along the global ocean coastline south of 60\u00b0N which may or may not be correct. Slope_100 Average slope within a 100 meter buffer around the lake polygon, in degrees. This value is derived from the EarthEnv-DEM90 digital elevation model at 90 m pixel resolution. Slopes for each pixel were computed with latitudinal corrections for the distortion in the XY spacing of geographic coordinates by approximating the geodesic distance between cell centers. For 12 lakes located above the northern limit of the EarthEnv-DEM90 digital elevation model (83\u00b0N), slopes were computed from the GTOPO30 DEM of USGS at 1 km pixel resolution. -1: slope values were not calculated for the largest lakes (polygon area \u2265 500 km2) Wshd_area Area of the watershed associated with the lake, in square kilometers. The watershed area is calculated by deriving and measuring the upstream contribution area to the lake pour point using the HydroSHEDS drainage network map at 15 arc-second resolution. -9999: no data as lake pour point is not on HydroSHEDS landmask Pour_long Longitude of the lake pour point, in decimal degrees.

LANDFIRE (LF) layers are created using predictive landscape models based on extensive field-referenced data, satellite imagery and biophysical gradient layers using classification and regression trees. You can read about the Landfire 2020 updates v2.2.0 here The LF 2020 Update represents the second step in moving towards an annual update in which the disturbances from the year before are represented in current year products. LANDFIRE (LF) 2019L (Limited) was the first step towards this goal but contained limited disturbance information (events and fire program data only) for the years 2017-2019. LF 2020 includes adjustments to vegetation and fuels in disturbed areas for disturbances recorded in 2017-2020. LF 2020 disturbance layers contain events, fire program data (Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS), Burned Area Reflectance Classification (BARC), Rapid Assessment of Vegetation Condition after Wildfire (RAVG)) and LF's remote sensing of landscape change (RSLC), which identifies spectral change in vegetation using automated algorithms and image analyst review. See the disturbance source information table. LF 2020 replaces LF 2019L in terms of disturbances accounted for in vegetation and fuels product layers as it includes all disturbances in LF 2019L plus additional disturbances from 2017-2019 identified by LF's RSLC process and an additional year of full disturbance mapping (2020). Both vegetation cover and height, as well as fuels, will be 2022 capable in disturbed areas.

LANDFIRE (LF) layers are created using predictive landscape models based on extensive field-referenced data, satellite imagery and biophysical gradient layers using classification and regression trees. You can read about the Landfire 2020 updates v2.2.0 here The LF 2020 Update represents the second step in moving towards an annual update in which the disturbances from the year before are represented in current year products. LANDFIRE (LF) 2019L (Limited) was the first step towards this goal but contained limited disturbance information (events and fire program data only) for the years 2017-2019. LF 2020 includes adjustments to vegetation and fuels in disturbed areas for disturbances recorded in 2017-2020. LF 2020 disturbance layers contain events, fire program data (Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS), Burned Area Reflectance Classification (BARC), Rapid Assessment of Vegetation Condition after Wildfire (RAVG)) and LF's remote sensing of landscape change (RSLC), which identifies spectral change in vegetation using automated algorithms and image analyst review. See the disturbance source information table. LF 2020 replaces LF 2019L in terms of disturbances accounted for in vegetation and fuels product layers as it includes all disturbances in LF 2019L plus additional disturbances from 2017-2019 identified by LF's RSLC process and an additional year of full disturbance mapping (2020). Both vegetation cover and height, as well as fuels, will be 2022 capable in disturbed areas. This means that in mapped disturbances, vegetation and fuels are \"grown\" to current (delivery) year conditions. Transition rulesets for vegetation account for disturbances from 2017-2020 (using LF 2016 Remap vegetation as an input), meaning that no vegetation disturbed prior to LF 2016 Remap will be transitioned from what was mapped at the time.

For example, natural and manmade disasters across the globe place vast populations at risk, often with little or no advance warning. It was critical to develop highly resolved estimates so that they were useful to evaluate to events across multiple geographic scales. This has been an annual product since 1998. Building on the modeling approach developed for LandScan Global, and taking advantage of higher quality data available for the U.S., we improved on both the spatial and the temporal resolution with our first version of LandScan USA in 2004. LandScan USA was created with the goal of capturing the diurnal variation of population that is critical for a variety of analyses and actions including emergency preparedness and response. In 2016, the original LandScan USA model was re-engineered to incoroporate advances in geospatial technology, machine learning approaches, and new input data sources. Since then, we have made annual improvements to the underlying model and released a new version of the dataset each year. Around the time LandScan USA was first initiated, ORNL was also pioneering work in machine learning and computer vision, specifically to identify anthropogenic signals apparent in overhead imagery. This work ultimately enabled rapid, large-scale detection of human settlements from high resolution imagery and became the basis for early efforts to develop an improved resolution population distribution outside the U.S. known as Landscan HD. LandScan HD model employs a mixture of multi-modal data fusion, spatial data science, big data resources, and satellite imagery exploitation.

Land Cover Class Description Developed Areas of intensive use with much of the land covered with structures (e.g., high-density residential, commercial, industrial, mining, or transportation), or less intensive uses where the land cover matrix includes vegetation, bare ground, and structures (e.g., low-density residential, recreational facilities, cemeteries, transportation/utility corridors, etc.), including any land functionality related to the developed or built-up activity. Cropland Land in either a vegetated or unvegetated state used in production of food, fiber, and fuels. This includes cultivated and uncultivated croplands, hay lands, orchards, vineyards, and confined livestock operations. Forest plantations are considered as forests or woodlands (Tree Cover class) regardless of the use of the wood products. Grass/Shrub Land predominantly covered with shrubs and perennial or annual natural and domesticated grasses (e.g., pasture), forbs, or other forms of herbaceous vegetation. The grass and shrub cover must comprise at least 10% of the area and tree cover is less than 10% of the area. Tree Cover Tree-covered land where the tree cover density is greater than 10%. Cleared or harvested trees (i.e., clearcuts) will be mapped according to current cover (e.g., Barren, Grass/Shrub). Water Areas covered with water, such as streams, canals, lakes, reservoirs, bays, or oceans. Wetland Lands where water saturation is the determining factor in soil characteristics, vegetation types, and animal communities. Wetlands are composed of mosaics of water, bare soil, and herbaceous or wooded vegetated cover. Ice/Snow Land where accumulated snow and ice does not completely melt during the summer period (i.e., perennial ice/snow). Barren Land comprised of natural occurrences of soils, sand, or rocks where less than 10% of the area is vegetated.

The study used a map-to-image approach to change detection where the baseline map (GMW v2.5) was updated using thresholding and a contextual mangrove change mask. This approach was applied between all image-date pairs producing 10 maps for each epoch, which were summarised to produce the global mangrove time-series. The resulting mangrove extent maps had an estimated accuracy of 87.4 % (95 th conf. int.: 86.2 - 88.6 %), although the accuracies of the individual gain and loss change classes were lower at 58.1 % (52.4 - 63.9 %) and 60.6 % (56.1 - 64.8 %), respectively. Sources of error included a mis-registration in the SAR mosaic datasets, which could only be partially corrected for, but also confusion in fragmented areas of mangroves, such as around aquaculture ponds. Overall, 152,604 km2 (133,996 - 176,910) of mangroves were identified for 1996, with this decreasing by -5,245 km2 (-13,587 - 3686) resulting in a total extent of 147,359 km2 (127,925 - 168,895) in 2020, and representing an estimated loss of 3.4 % over the 24-year time period. The Global Mangrove Watch Version 3.0 represents the most comprehensive record of global mangrove change achieved to date and is expected to support a wide range of activities, including the ongoing monitoring of the global coastal environment, defining and assessments of progress towards conservation targets, protected area planning and risk assessments of mangrove ecosystems worldwide.

This includes all fires 1000 acres or greater in the western United States and 500 acres or greater in the eastern Unites States. The extent of coverage includes the continental U.S., Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico. The program is conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey Center for Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) and the USDA Forest Service Geospatial Technology and Applications Center (GTAC). The two datasets included in this package include The fire occurrence location dataset is a vector point ESRI shapefile of the centroids of all currently completed MTBS fires occurring in the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico. The burned area boundaries dataset is a vector polygon ESRI shapefile of the extent of the burned areas of all currently completed MTBS fires for the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico. You can read the MTBS overview paper here In the MTBS project (from the FAQ page ), \"burn severity\" refers specifically to fire effects on above-ground biomass. The definition is drawn from the reference: NWCG Glossary of Wildland Fire Terms and is based on the term Fire Severity, which is defined as: \"Degree to which a site has been altered or disrupted by fire; loosely, a product of fire intensity and residence time.\" The following additional statements further clarify the nature of the products developed by this project: Burn severity is a composite of first-order effects and second order effects that arise within one growing season. Burn severity relates principally to visible changes in living and non-living biomass, fire byproducts (scorch, char, ash), and soil exposure. Burn severity occurs on a gradient or ordinal scale. Burn severity is a mosaic of effects that occur within a fire perimeter. Longer term effects are controlled by variables that evolve after a fire and are beyond the scope of this program. Burn severity is mappable and remotely sensed data provide a measurement framework.

The extent of coverage includes the continental U.S., Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico. The program is conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey Center for Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) and the USDA Forest Service Geospatial Technology and Applications Center (GTAC). The two datasets included in this package include The fire occurrence location dataset is a vector point ESRI shapefile of the centroids of all currently completed MTBS fires occurring in the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico. The burned area boundaries dataset is a vector polygon ESRI shapefile of the extent of the burned areas of all currently completed MTBS fires for the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico. You can read the MTBS overview paper here In the MTBS project (from the FAQ page ), \"burn severity\" refers specifically to fire effects on above-ground biomass. The definition is drawn from the reference: NWCG Glossary of Wildland Fire Terms and is based on the term Fire Severity, which is defined as: \"Degree to which a site has been altered or disrupted by fire; loosely, a product of fire intensity and residence time.\" The following additional statements further clarify the nature of the products developed by this project: Burn severity is a composite of first-order effects and second order effects that arise within one growing season. Burn severity relates principally to visible changes in living and non-living biomass, fire byproducts (scorch, char, ash), and soil exposure. Burn severity occurs on a gradient or ordinal scale. Burn severity is a mosaic of effects that occur within a fire perimeter. Longer term effects are controlled by variables that evolve after a fire and are beyond the scope of this program. Burn severity is mappable and remotely sensed data provide a measurement framework.

The authors used data on waste management, population density, and hydrological information to create this model. The dataset includes information on 40,760 watersheds and 182 different countries. The data is presented in a vector format. Plastic pollution in our oceans and on our coastlines have become a major threat to ocean health worldwide.

This data can also be used as a baseline measurement for ocean plastic mass balance exercises. This data was developed by researchers funded by The Ocean Cleanup Foundation. Methodology \u00b6 The amount of plastic inputs from rivers into the oceans was estimated by using data on mismanaged plastic waste production (MPW) per country, population density, topographic elevation, and location of artificial barriers (weirs and dams). For each catchment area mismanaged plastic waste production (MPW) rates per day were calculated by combining data on waste generation by inhabitant per day and population density for the area. This data was combined with water flow per river catchment area to provide a final value for the mass of plastic released at the river\u2019s mouth. This data was extrapolated using seasonal variations in water flow to create a year dataset. Data on population density was derived from the dataset Global 15 x 15 Minute Grids of the Downscaled Population by the Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC) for 182 countries. Data used to calculate MPW rates were collected from seven peer reviewed studies. Topographic information was taken from Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) hydrological model for surface/subsurface runoff and location of artificial barriers was taken from AquaStat and Global Reservoir and Dam Database (GRanD).

Dataset Record \u00b6 The VV and VH mosaics are sampled at 10 m pixel spacing, georeferenced to the Equi7Grid and divided into six continental zones (Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania, South America), which are further divided into square tiles of 100 km extent (\"T1\"-tiles). With this setup, the S1GBM consists of 16071 tiles over six continents, for VV and VH each, totaling to a compressed data volume of 2.67 TB. The files were distributed as aggregated zipfiles with a total of 12 zip files. The tiles' file-format is a LZW-compressed GeoTIFF holding 16-bit integer values, with tagged metadata on encoding and georeference.

It is being made public to act as supplementary data for the publication 'Large soil carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems of Canada', currently under review. The maps were produced in the Remote Sensing Lab, McMaster University, between January and December 2020. This research project was made possible by a grant from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF)- Canada. This project aimed to produce the first wall-to-wall estimate of carbon stocks in plants and soils of Canada at 250 m spatial resolution using multisource satellite, climate and topographic data and a machine-learning algorithm.

We created wall-to-wall height metrics using ATL08 LiDAR products from the ICESat-2 satellite. The data was download for one-year period (October 2018 to October 2019). Points were filtered regarding solar background noise and atmospheric scattering, totaling 49,959 points distributed over the entire Canada. These points were associated with 10 ancillary variables primarily corresponding to structure information, such as seasonal Sentinel-1 VV and VH polarization, annual PALSAR-2 HH and HV polarization, annual clumping index, and also the MODIS NDVI summer season. Afterwards, the random forest algorithm was used to extrapolate ATL08 parameters and develop regression models with the abovementioned spatially continuous variables. Soil Carbon Concentration To generate the soil carbon concentration maps, we used 6,533 ground soil samples, long-term climate data, multisource remote sensing data, topografic information, soil type, depth, and a 3D random forest regression model. Forest Carbon This dataset contains the map with total carbon stored in plants of forested areas in Canada (AGB, BGB and dead plants) and carbon stock uncertainty. To estimate the carbon stored in plants of forest areas, we used 47,967 ground measurements of AGB and 58 covariates mainly composed of optical data, terrain parameters, structural parameters (e.g., SAR data, clump index, canopy heights \u2013 generated from satellite LiDAR- included in the other dataset), soil type map and radiation flux data. We used a random forest model for spatial prediction of AGB in forest areas while 1 st and 3 rd quantiles of RF quantile regression were used to build the uncertainty map. After generating the AGB map, the root biomass of forest areas was computed by its relationship to AGB according to forest type. The dead plant materials were computed by a linear regression between live and dead AGB defined with ground measurements. Ultimately, the AGB as well as dead plant materials and BGB were multiplied by 0.5 to provide the carbon maps. includes carbon stored in above and belowground biomass and dead plant materials Soil Carbon Stock Map To generate the soil carbon stock map, we used 6,490 ground samples of soil organic carbon concentration (g/kg) and 2,973 ground samples of bulk density (kg/dm3), long-term climate data, multisource remote sensing data, topografic information, soil type, depth, and a 3D random forest regression model. The uncertainty map was generated using the random forest quantile regression approach difference between 95 th and 5 th quantiles (90% confidence interval) of soil organic carbon and bulk density predictions. Water and ice/snow areas were masked based on the 2015 Land Cover of Canada and SOC stock in permafrost areas was discounted according to ice abundance using the 'Ground ice map of Canada' (O'Neill et al., 2020) .

These points were associated with 10 ancillary variables primarily corresponding to structure information, such as seasonal Sentinel-1 VV and VH polarization, annual PALSAR-2 HH and HV polarization, annual clumping index, and also the MODIS NDVI summer season. Afterwards, the random forest algorithm was used to extrapolate ATL08 parameters and develop regression models with the abovementioned spatially continuous variables. Soil Carbon Concentration To generate the soil carbon concentration maps, we used 6,533 ground soil samples, long-term climate data, multisource remote sensing data, topografic information, soil type, depth, and a 3D random forest regression model. Forest Carbon This dataset contains the map with total carbon stored in plants of forested areas in Canada (AGB, BGB and dead plants) and carbon stock uncertainty. To estimate the carbon stored in plants of forest areas, we used 47,967 ground measurements of AGB and 58 covariates mainly composed of optical data, terrain parameters, structural parameters (e.g., SAR data, clump index, canopy heights \u2013 generated from satellite LiDAR- included in the other dataset), soil type map and radiation flux data. We used a random forest model for spatial prediction of AGB in forest areas while 1 st and 3 rd quantiles of RF quantile regression were used to build the uncertainty map. After generating the AGB map, the root biomass of forest areas was computed by its relationship to AGB according to forest type. The dead plant materials were computed by a linear regression between live and dead AGB defined with ground measurements. Ultimately, the AGB as well as dead plant materials and BGB were multiplied by 0.5 to provide the carbon maps. includes carbon stored in above and belowground biomass and dead plant materials Soil Carbon Stock Map To generate the soil carbon stock map, we used 6,490 ground samples of soil organic carbon concentration (g/kg) and 2,973 ground samples of bulk density (kg/dm3), long-term climate data, multisource remote sensing data, topografic information, soil type, depth, and a 3D random forest regression model. The uncertainty map was generated using the random forest quantile regression approach difference between 95 th and 5 th quantiles (90% confidence interval) of soil organic carbon and bulk density predictions. Water and ice/snow areas were masked based on the 2015 Land Cover of Canada and SOC stock in permafrost areas was discounted according to ice abundance using the 'Ground ice map of Canada' (O'Neill et al., 2020) .

Accurate estimation of terrestrial GPP is critical for understanding the interaction between the terrestrial biosphere and the atmosphere in the context of global climate change projecting future change, and informing climate policy decisions. GPP is closely related to vegetation types meteorological factors, soil moisture, and other factors. In particular, GPP is affected by vegetation canopy structures e.g., sunlit and shaded leaves. Sunlit leaves can absorb direct and diffuse radiation simultaneously, and light saturation is easy to occur when the radiation is high, while shaded leaves can only absorb diffuse radiation and the absorbed radiation intensity is generally between the light compensation point and the light saturation point.

Find the GitHub project and datasets here: https://github.com/teamookla/ookla-open-data You can also download the datasets from AWS Open data registry: https://registry.opendata.aws/speedtest-global-performance/ Tiles \u00b6 Hundreds of millions of Speedtests are taken on the Ookla platform each month. In order to create a manageable dataset, we aggregate raw data into tiles. The size of a data tile is defined as a function of \"zoom level\" (or \"z\"). At z=0, the size of a tile is the size of the whole world. At z=1, the tile is split in half vertically and horizontally, creating 4 tiles that cover the globe. This tile-splitting continues as zoom level increases, causing tiles to become exponentially smaller as we zoom into a given region. By this definition, tile sizes are actually some fraction of the width/height of Earth according to Web Mercator projection (EPSG:3857). As such, tile size varies slightly depending on latitude, but tile sizes can be estimated in meters. For the purposes of these layers, a zoom level of 16 (z=16) is used for the tiling. This equates to a tile that is approximately 610.8 meters by 610.8 meters at the equator (18 arcsecond blocks). The geometry of each tile is represented in WGS 84 (EPSG:4326) in the tile field. Tile Attributes \u00b6 Each tile contains the following adjoining attributes: Field Name Type Description avg_d_kbps Integer The average download speed of all tests performed in the tile, represented in kilobits per second. avg_u_kbps Integer The average upload speed of all tests performed in the tile, represented in kilobits per second. avg_lat_ms Integer The average latency of all tests performed in the tile, represented in milliseconds tests Integer The number of tests taken in the tile. devices Integer The number of unique devices contributing tests in the tile. quadkey Text The quadkey representing the tile. Quadkeys \u00b6 Quadkeys can act as a unique identifier for the tile. This can be useful for joining data spatially from multiple periods (quarters), creating coarser spatial aggregations without using geospatial functions, spatial indexing, partitioning, and an alternative for storing and deriving the tile geometry. Layers \u00b6 Two layers are distributed as separate sets of files: performance_mobile_tiles - Tiles containing tests taken from mobile devices with GPS-quality location and a cellular connection type (e.g. 4G LTE, 5G NR). performance_fixed_tiles - Tiles containing tests taken from mobile devices with GPS-quality location and a non-cellular connection type (e.g. WiFi, ethernet). Time Period and Update Frequency \u00b6 Layers are generated based on a quarter year of data (three months) and files will be updated and added on a quarterly basis. A /year=2020/quarter=1/ period, the first quarter of the year 2020, would include all data generated on or after 2020-01-01 and before 2020-04-01 .

In this study, we developed a Fine-resolution, Large-area Urban Thematic information Extraction (FLUTE) framework to address multiple challenges facing large-area, high-resolution urban mapping, including the view angle effect, high intraclass and low interclass variation, and multiscale land cover types. FLUTE builds upon a teacher-student deep learning architecture and includes two new feature extraction modules \u2013 Scale-aware Parsing Module (SPM) and View-aware Embedding Module (VEM). Our model was trained with a new benchmark database containing 52.43 million labeled pixels (from 2014 to 2017 NAIP airborne Imagery) to capture diverse LCLU types and spatial patterns. We assessed the credibility of FLUTE by producing a 1-meter resolution database named UrbanWatch for 22 major cities across the conterminous United States. UrbanWatch contains nine LCLU classes \u2013 building, road, parking lot, tree canopy, grass/shrub, water, agriculture, barren, and others, with an overall accuracy of 91.52%.

In this study, we developed a Fine-resolution, Large-area Urban Thematic information Extraction (FLUTE) framework to address multiple challenges facing large-area, high-resolution urban mapping, including the view angle effect, high intraclass and low interclass variation, and multiscale land cover types. FLUTE builds upon a teacher-student deep learning architecture and includes two new feature extraction modules \u2013 Scale-aware Parsing Module (SPM) and View-aware Embedding Module (VEM). Our model was trained with a new benchmark database containing 52.43 million labeled pixels (from 2014 to 2017 NAIP airborne Imagery) to capture diverse LCLU types and spatial patterns. We assessed the credibility of FLUTE by producing a 1-meter resolution database named UrbanWatch for 22 major cities across the conterminous United States. UrbanWatch contains nine LCLU classes \u2013 building, road, parking lot, tree canopy, grass/shrub, water, agriculture, barren, and others, with an overall accuracy of 91.52%.

The Chen et al. dataset provides a binary classification of urban and non-urban land (pixel value of 2 for urban; 1 otherwise) at 1 km resolution for every 10 th year from 2020 to 2100 (inclusive). On the other hand, the Gao & O'Neill (2020) dataset provides continuous values representing the probability of full urbanization of each \u215b degree grid for the same years. When using these future projections, it is important to recognize that they are based on different methodologies, different training data, and different assumptions about future scenarios. For instance, the Gao & O'Neill dataset considers broad urbanization patterns across 375 sub-regions, while the Chen et al. data uses 32 regions. While both of these datasets are trained using the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL), the Chen et al. data are further calibrated against the European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI) data for 2015.

The map uses five classifications: abnormally dry (D0), showing areas that may be going into or are coming out of drought, and four levels of drought: moderate (D1), severe (D2), extreme (D3) and exceptional (D4). The Drought Monitor has been a team effort since its inception in 1999, produced jointly by the National Drought Mitigation Center (NDMC) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The NDMC hosts the web site of the drought monitor and the associated data, and provides the map and data to NOAA, USDA and other agencies. It is freely available at droughtmonitor.unl.edu. Unlike most of the weather maps people see in the news, the U.S. Drought Monitor is not a forecast. In fact, it looks backward. It\u2019s a weekly assessment of drought conditions, based on how much precipitation did or didn\u2019t fall, up to the Tuesday morning before the map comes out. That gives authors about two working days to review the latest data. If a lot of rain falls in a drought area on a Wednesday, the soonest drought would be removed from the map is the following week. Drought is a slow-moving hazard, so you can be certain that an area will still be in drought if it doesn\u2019t get rain. But it also may take more than one good rainfall to end a drought, especially if an area has been in drought for a long time. Preprocessing \u00b6 Drought Monitor GIS Data is available as shapefiles . To create a consistent data structure, the shapefiles are ingested for all years starting from 2000 and with a weekly cadence. These have 5 different drought classes/categories and are converted into a raster with the DM(Drought Monitor class/category values) as raster property. This makes using it as collection and analysis of the data much easier. Start and end dates are added with the release week date as the end date and a week ago as a start date. For now the goal is to keep this collection updated so that this dataset is consistently synced with the source dataset. Earth Engine Snippet \u00b6 var usdm = ee .

The map uses five classifications: abnormally dry (D0), showing areas that may be going into or are coming out of drought, and four levels of drought: moderate (D1), severe (D2), extreme (D3) and exceptional (D4). The Drought Monitor has been a team effort since its inception in 1999, produced jointly by the National Drought Mitigation Center (NDMC) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The NDMC hosts the web site of the drought monitor and the associated data, and provides the map and data to NOAA, USDA and other agencies. It is freely available at droughtmonitor.unl.edu. Unlike most of the weather maps people see in the news, the U.S. Drought Monitor is not a forecast. In fact, it looks backward. It\u2019s a weekly assessment of drought conditions, based on how much precipitation did or didn\u2019t fall, up to the Tuesday morning before the map comes out. That gives authors about two working days to review the latest data. If a lot of rain falls in a drought area on a Wednesday, the soonest drought would be removed from the map is the following week. Drought is a slow-moving hazard, so you can be certain that an area will still be in drought if it doesn\u2019t get rain. But it also may take more than one good rainfall to end a drought, especially if an area has been in drought for a long time.","title":"United States Drought Monitor"},{"location":"projects/usdm/#preprocessing","text":"Drought Monitor GIS Data is available as shapefiles . To create a consistent data structure, the shapefiles are ingested for all years starting from 2000 and with a weekly cadence. These have 5 different drought classes/categories and are converted into a raster with the DM(Drought Monitor class/category values) as raster property. This makes using it as collection and analysis of the data much easier. Start and end dates are added with the release week date as the end date and a week ago as a start date. For now the goal is to keep this collection updated so that this dataset is consistently synced with the source dataset.","title":"Preprocessing"},{"location":"projects/usdm/#earth-engine-snippet","text":"var usdm = ee .

Object-based image analysis techniques (OBIA) were employed to extract land cover information using the best available remotely sensed and vector GIS datasets. OBIA systems work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties, while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets. Within the OBIA environment a rule-based expert system was designed to effectively mimic the process of manual image analysis by incorporating the elements of image interpretation (color/tone, texture, pattern, location, size, and shape) into the classification process. A series of morphological procedures were employed to insure that the end product is both accurate and cartographically pleasing. Following the automated OBIA mapping a detailed manual review of the dataset was carried out at a scale of 1:3000 and all observable errors were corrected.

As such, it represents a 'top down' mapping perspective in which tree canopy over hanging other features is assigned to the tree canopy class.

The world settlement footprint 2015 is now available in the official GEE catalog and you can find it here The entire catalog consists of 306 GeoTIFF files (EPSG4326 projection, deflate compression) each one referring to a portion of 10x10 degree size (~1110x1110km) whose upper-left and lower-right corner coordinates are specified in the file name [e.g., the tile WSF2015_v1_EPSG4326_e010_n60_e020_n50.tif covers the area between (10E;60N) and (20E;50N)]. Settlements are associated with value 255; all other pixels are associated with value 0. World Settlement Footprint (WSF) 2019 \u00b6 The World Settlement Footprint (WSF 2019) is a 10m resolution binary mask outlining the extent of human settlements globally derived by means of 2019 multitemporal Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery. The dataset is organized in 5138 GeoTIFF files (EPSG4326 projection) each one referring to a portion of 2x2 degree size (~222x222km on the ground) with an extra buffer of 0.1 degree to avoid any discontinuity between neighbour tiles. Each tile is identified by the lower-left corner coordinates specified in the file name [e.g., the tile WSF2019_v1_12_18.tif covers the area between (12E;18N) and (14E;20N)]. You can download the files here Settlements are associated with value 255; all other pixels are associated with value 0. World Settlement Footprint Evolution (1985-2015) \u00b6 This repository contains the World Settlement Footprint (WSF) Evolution, a 30m resolution layer outlining the global settlement extent on a yearly basis from 1985 to 2015 derived by means of multitemporal Landsat-5 and Landsat-7 imagery. The dataset is organized in 5138 GeoTIFF files (EPSG4326 projection) each one referring to a portion of 2x2 degree size (~222x222km on the ground) with an extra buffer of 0.1 degree to avoid any discontinuity between neighbour tiles. Each tile is identified by the lower-left corner coordinates specified in the file name [e.g., the tile WSFevolution_v1_12_18.tif covers the area between (12E;18N) and (14E;20N)]. You can download the files here Values range between 1985 and 2015 corresponding to the estimated year of settlement detection, whereas 0 is no data. World Settlement Footprint Evolution: Input Data Consistency Score \u00b6 This repository contains the Input Data Consistency (IDC) score, which provides a suitable and intuitive measure that accounts for the goodness of the Landsat imagery used for generating the WSF evolution and supports a proper interpretation of the product. The dataset is organized in 5138 GeoTIFF files (EPSG4326 projection) each one referring to a portion of 2x2 degree size (~222x222km on the ground) with an extra buffer of 0.1 degree to avoid any discontinuity between neighbour tiles.
